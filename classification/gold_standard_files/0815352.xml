        <p>THE ALL-AMERICAN SKIN GAME, OR, THE DECOY OF RACE The Long and the Short of It, 1990-1994 By Stanley Crouch 267 pages. Pantheon Books. $24.</p>
        <p>Before he became a contributing editor to The New Republic and a columnist for The Sunday News, Stanley Crouch was a jazz critic for The Village Voice. So  his oldest love is jazz, and his book, "The All-American Skin Game," reflects this in a variety of ways.</p>
        <p>For one thing, some of the speeches, essays and reviews collected in it have titles like "The B &amp; J Blues" (the initials referring to Blacks and Jews), "Black Power Redux Blues" and "Another Long Drink of the Blues: The Race Card in the Simpson Case." For another thing, the most considered and best-written pieces in the book are essays on Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Wynton Marsalis.</p>
        <p>More significant, Mr. Crouch roots his celebratory vision of American democracy in a comparison of that system to jazz, which he calls "the highest American musical form because it is the most comprehensive, possessing an epic frame of emotional and intellectual reference, sensual clarity and spiritual radiance."</p>
        <p>Extending the comparison, he writes: "The demands on and the respect for the  individual in the jazz band put democracy into esthetic action." He continues: "The success of jazz is a victory for democracy, and a symbol of the esthetic dignity, which is finally spiritual, that performers can achieve and express as  they go about inventing music and meeting the challenge of the moment."</p>
        <p>This is the ground on which Mr. Crouch praises such heroes of his as the writers Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray, both of whom he reveres for pulling in  "all of the highest intellectual aspirations and achievements from the world over" and combining them with "the democratic complexities so inherent to our nation." And it is the ground on which he attacks those he considers his enemies: on the one hand those who define "Afro-Americans as a long lost group uninformed by the African cultural principles that supply the best defense against an irrevocably hostile white world"; on the other hand "Marx's descendants," who argue that "we take our position in a sentimentalized proletariat, not just victimized by class but also racially excluded from getting a grip on the means of production."</p>
        <p>Mr. Crouch loves the stew of American democracy, the ferment of nationalities; what he calls the "gumbo" of our culture and "our miscegenated identity as Americans." This allows him to answer the question raised by Charles Murray in "The Bell Curve" of whether "the majority of Negroes," in Mr. Crouch's words, "are doomed by their genes to be less intelligent than white people." Mr. Crouch simply asserts that "no matter your definition of Afro-American culture, there is, quite frankly, no Afro-American race."</p>
        <p>This outlook also permits him to belittle the threat of black anti-Semitism on the theory that "Negroes and Jews" share a "tragicomic sensibility, as it has translated itself into music, dance, comedy and drama." He argues that one reason "the ranks of the Nation of Islam don't swell" is "that Negro-Americans are not puritanical and have never been attracted to religious orders that frowned upon joy." He adds, "The members of the Nation of Islam are a dour bunch -- far too dour to ever appeal to more than a cult faction of the black American community."</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Crouch's love of jazz is most evident in sentences he writes that roll on and on, dipping and soaring like a trumpeter laying out a lick. For instance, of Dizzy Gillespie, he writes, "He rose from the position of an odd fish to a star surfer riding the high, high curving water of a trend, sank into  the position of those miracles taken for granted, but periodically returned to view, dripping with new wisdoms, beckoning as others followed him on the thin boards of art and entertainment that those who make their name in jazz must ride, atop the roller coaster waves of public taste, swinging all our blues in a fickle brine where they are forever at peril."</p>
        <p>This improvisatory style works well for him when it takes surprising turns, like pulling in a quote from Thomas Mann's 1938 book "The Coming Victory of Democracy" to illustrate his point about the convergence of jazz and democracy.  Or like citing Isaiah Berlin's book "The Crooked Timber of Humanity" to compare  Afrocentrism's attitude toward Western culture with German mistrust of France at the time of the Thirty Years' War.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Crouch's style can also go astray. Occasionally the metaphors grow overripe to the point of spoiling: "The coming to power of Christendom led to Jews being demonized by the dark and poisonous side of the udder from which drips also the milk of Western civilization."</p>
        <p>And you wish he would elaborate on certain observations instead of sounding them as mere riffs. What exactly does he mean when he writes that "like our economy, our cities, and our universities, our long fiction has been in trouble  for years"? What is he getting at when he writes that where Picasso "enriched Western plastic art with African abstraction," Marlon Brando "brought into our cinematic iconography the posings and simmerings of the Negro facial expression  that we associate with people like Miles Davis"?</p>
        <p>Still, you come away from "The All-American Skin Game" fired with new enthusiasms. Mr. Crouch makes you want to see films like Albert and Allen Hughes's "Menace II Society" and Leon Ichaso's "Sugar Hill." He makes you want to listen to Wynton Marsalis's composition "In This House, on This Morning." He  makes you want to reread Saul Bellow's novel "Mr. Sammler's Planet" for subtleties perhaps missed the first time around. He challenges your assumptions  and arouses your curiosity. And that is what a good cultural critic is for.</p>
