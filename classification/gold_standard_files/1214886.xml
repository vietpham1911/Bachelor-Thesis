        <p>The tale of the emperor's new clothes has been around a long time. But how about defining another category of mass delusion, the emperor's new book: the insanely popular, often intellectually intimidating book that sells hundreds of thousands of copies (sometimes even millions) but that few people actually read.</p>
        <p>The phenomenon of the unread best seller comes to mind because of the recent publication of ''Ravelstein,'' Saul Bellow's novel about the life and death of his friend Allan Bloom. In life, Bloom was a humanities professor well known only in the academy who gained international fame in 1987 after the surprising success of his dense treatise ''The Closing of the American Mind.'' To this day, many consider it one of the prime examples of an emperor's new book.</p>
        <p>Another classic example also comes from the 1980's: Stephen Hawking's ''Brief History of Time'' remains no doubt the most abstruse volume ever to sell nearly nine million copies around the world.</p>
        <p>Figuring out which best sellers go unread is not easy, since most people don't want to admit to the unfinished state of their reading. Much of the evidence is anecdotal. Bloom and Hawking, for instance, were the universal first responses when a small sampling of people in the book business were asked about unread best sellers. But a somewhat more solid indicator of unread books emerged in 1985 when Michael Kinsley, then of The New Republic, acted on his suspicions about reading habits in the nation's capital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kinsley and a colleague put coupons redeemable for five dollars each in the back of 70 copies of selected books in Washington bookstores. Two of the books were ''Deadly Gambits: The Reagan Administration and the Stalemate in Nuclear Arms Control'' by Strobe Talbott and ''The Good News Is the Bad News Is Wrong'' by Ben J. Wattenberg. Though neither was a national best seller, they were chosen, Mr. Kinsley said, as the kinds of books Washingtonians were most likely to claim to have read. No one ever redeemed a coupon. The Kinsley report may be as scientific a study as there is.</p>
        <p>The unread best seller seems to be a subject that makes many people, and not just book buyers, uncomfortable. One New York retailer at first said, ''We do regularly laugh about this,'' and quickly named the latest Tom Wolfe novel, ''A Man in Full'' (''Everybody thought they had to have it'') and Harold Bloom's ''Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human'' (''Everybody would like to think they're going to read that much about Shakespeare, but then they don't'') as two books she thought were more bought than read. But ultimately she decided not to be quoted by name. Still, she did recount the story of a friend's husband who had ''actually read the Hawking and then went around for a month trying to get a conversation going about it -- but no one else had read it.''</p>
        <p>Others are more forthright. Michael Willis was the marketing director at the Free Press in 1994, when the company published ''The Bell Curve'' by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray.''We thought it was very much the case that both professionals and the general public bought it to have it and didn't read it,'' he says. ''We got the sense even from reviews that people basically read the first chapter and the last.''</p>
        <p>Jack Cella is the manager of the Seminary Co-op Bookstore, a cooperative bookstore near the University of Chicago that has numbered both Allan Bloom and  Bellow among its members. He suggests that Seamus Heaney's ''Beowulf'' is a current example of the unread best seller. ''I'm pleased but astounded by the number of copies we've sold,'' he says. Has he read it? ''No, I haven't read it. But I did buy it. I'm a prime example.'' Now that an audio version of the poem, with Heaney reading his translation, has been released, Mr. Cella says he plans to ''listen to it in the car'' on his summer vacation.</p>
        <p>He adds, by the way, that ''The Closing of the American Mind'' was not only read by its Co-op buyers, many of whom knew Bloom, but was also probably the fastest-selling book in the store's history until, of course, ''Ravelstein.''</p>
        <p>There is a long, unshameful history to the unread best seller, according to Alberto Manguel, the author of ''The History of Reading.'' In citing classic examples, Mr. Manguel looks back a little further than Heaney, Hawking and the Blooms to Venice in the 16th century.</p>
        <p>The printer Aldus Manutius created what Mr. Manguel calls ''the most beautiful books ever made.'' One of his greatest creations was a series of ''exquisite little books that were the first pocket books of the classics.'' Printed in Greek and Latin, they were published when ''the ancients were read very much as contemporary, and the discovery of a new essay by Cicero was as fashionable or as interesting as Tom Wolfe.'' Knowing the market, Manutius sized the books with the ''intention that they would be read by everybody.'' However, whole series of his editions can be found today in what Mr. Manguel describes as ''pristine condition.''The aristocracy of the time, he says, ''would buy them and put them on the shelf.''</p>
        <p>And not only the aristocracy. The 1535 ''Price List of the Whores of Venice,'' a racy catalog that detailed the services each woman would perform, includes, Mr. Manguel says, an entry for one Lucrezia Squarcia, a prostitute who, according to the guide, was ''always with a pocket book of Petrarch, Virgil and sometimes even Homer.''</p>
        <p>The price guide went on to say that Lucrezia only pretended to love poetry.But in the desire to impress, perhaps there is a little Lucrezia Squarcia in all of us.</p>
