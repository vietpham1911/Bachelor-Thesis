EAST, WEST: Stories, by Salman Rushdie. (Pantheon, $21.) Nine stories by the fugitive author of "The Satanic Verses," some boisterous, some provocative, all taking some advantage of Mr. Rushdie's difficult dual heritage.  FELICIA'S JOURNEY, by William Trevor. (Viking, $21.95.)

THE MASTER OF PETERSBURG, by J.M. Coetzee. (Viking, $21.95.)

NELSON: A Personal History, by Christopher Hibbert. (Addison-Wesley, $30.) A biography that visits many familiar scenes but brings clarity, reliability, convincing judgments and enthusiasm to Horatio Nelson, a unique British hero whose defects could never tarnish his glory.  NIGHT: Night Life, Night Language, Sleep, and Dreams, by A. Alvarez. (Norton, $23.) Personal and literary explorations of the less visible (and therefore more conjectural) half of life by a gifted critic and acutely intuitive memoirist.  ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON: A Biography, by Frank McLynn. (Random House, $30.) A thoroughly detailed life, taking the most recent scholarship into account, of the great Scottish writer of English prose who died at 44 in 1894.

        <p>And Bear in Mind (Editor's Choices of other recent books of particular interest) ALLAH O AKBAR: A Journey Through Militant Islam, by Abbas. (Phaidon/Chronicle, $60.) A broad and gloomy photographic examination of 29 countries by an Iranian-born photojournalist whose subjects seem rarely to take any time out from the utmost rigors of the faith.  EAST, WEST: Stories, by Salman Rushdie. (Pantheon, $21.) Nine stories by the fugitive author of "The Satanic Verses," some boisterous, some provocative, all taking some advantage of Mr. Rushdie's difficult dual heritage.  FELICIA'S JOURNEY, by William Trevor. (Viking, $21.95.) Mr. Trevor's latest novel concerns an unmarried, pregnant, vulnerable Irish girl, wandering England's industrial Midlands until she encounters an awesomely predatory Englishman whose monstrosity is all the scarier for remaining long undefined.  THE HOLLOW YEARS: France in the 1930s, by Eugen Weber. (Norton, $25.) The author, a historian devoted to France, rises from immersion in the documents, bearing this scintillating, entertaining account of an unworthy but fascinating period in French life.  IN PHARAOH'S ARMY: Memories of the Lost War, by Tobias Wolff. (Knopf, $23.) The follow-up volume to Mr. Wolff's memoir "This Boy's Life" is a series of small, elegant, personal sketches of his year in Vietnam.  AN INTIMATE HISTORY OF HUMANITY, by Theodore Zeldin. (HarperCollins, $25.) Not history so much as informed rumination by an Oxford social historian who talks to many people (mostly Frenchwomen) about the fundamentals of human experience -- hope, despair, love, etc. -- and thinks that hope still has a chance.  THE MASTER OF PETERSBURG, by J.M. Coetzee. (Viking, $21.95.) The hero of Mr. Coetzee's grimmest novel yet is Dostoyevsky himself, trapped in generational and political clashes, trying to scrape meaning from the death of a son.  NELSON: A Personal History, by Christopher Hibbert. (Addison-Wesley, $30.) A biography that visits many familiar scenes but brings clarity, reliability, convincing judgments and enthusiasm to Horatio Nelson, a unique British hero whose defects could never tarnish his glory.  NIGHT: Night Life, Night Language, Sleep, and Dreams, by A. Alvarez. (Norton, $23.) Personal and literary explorations of the less visible (and therefore more conjectural) half of life by a gifted critic and acutely intuitive memoirist.  ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON: A Biography, by Frank McLynn. (Random House, $30.) A thoroughly detailed life, taking the most recent scholarship into account, of the great Scottish writer of English prose who died at 44 in 1894.  SHAKER BUILT: The Form and Function of Shaker Architecture, by Paul Rocheleau and June Sprigg, edited and designed by David Larkin. (David Larkin/Monacelli Press/Penguin, $50.) Sumptuous color photographs of Shaker buildings, taken with care and devotion.</p>
