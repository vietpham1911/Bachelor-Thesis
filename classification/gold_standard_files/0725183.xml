        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In response to Malcolm W. Browne's review of books on race and I.Q., Will Pflaum has written a letter to The Times Book Review that was also distributed on the E-mail network of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society, a discussion group composed mainly of evolutionary scientists. Mr. Pflaum repudiates racial groupings as they appear in "Race, Evolution, and Behavior" and "The Bell Curve," and also demands a fully worked-out theoretical rationale for racial differences before we even begin to consider the empirical evidence.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In response to Malcolm W. Browne's review of books on race and I.Q., Will Pflaum has written a letter to The Times Book Review that was also distributed on the E-mail network of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society, a discussion group composed mainly of evolutionary scientists. Mr. Pflaum repudiates racial groupings as they appear in "Race, Evolution, and Behavior" and "The Bell Curve," and also demands a fully worked-out theoretical rationale for racial differences before we even begin to consider the empirical evidence.</p>
        <p>The repudiation of racial groupings simply ignores well-established, interlocking forms of physiological, anatomical and genetic evidence for these groupings. The demand for an evolutionary rationale overlooks the fact that J. Philippe Rushton offers a strong causal, evolutionary hypothesis. Whether ultimately right or wrong, his hypothesis is a starting point for further research. Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray offer very little in the way of a causal theory; they're just organizing empirical information. But to repudiate all empirical information unless it already fits within a fully established causal theory -- as Mr. Pflaum demands -- is wholly arbitrary. Such ad hoc methodological restrictions are merely strategies of obfuscation and intellectual obstruction disguising themselves as scientific rigor. This kind of thing is, of course, nothing new. What is new, and worthy of some quiet celebration, is that objective scientific studies like those reviewed in the Book Review could get a fair, thoughtful and reasonable hearing in a major public forum.
