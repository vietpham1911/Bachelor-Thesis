        <p>A Jan. 16 news article reports the formation of a nationwide anti-affirmative action group by those who persuaded California voters to abolish preferences in hiring, contracting and college admissions.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A Jan. 16 news article reports the formation of a nationwide anti-affirmative action group by those who persuaded California voters to abolish preferences in hiring, contracting and college admissions. You quote Ward Connerly, the head of the new American Civil Rights Institute, as saying that ''there is no public policy which has greater potential to rip the fabric of American democracy than affirmative action.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, you quote Wade Henderson, a Washington-based civil rights leader, as saying that the institute ''won't get very high priority here, particularly after the discrimination that has recently been turned up at places like Texaco.'' Such remarks are typical of the kid-glove treatment expected by many affirmative action advocates.</p>
        <p>In the Texaco case, black employees received raises that brought them to salary equality with their white counterparts. To Mr. Henderson this might sound fair, but would it sound fair to Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, who in their book, ''The Bell Curve,'' show that income equality already exists in corporate America if the determining factor is I.Q., not race?</p>
