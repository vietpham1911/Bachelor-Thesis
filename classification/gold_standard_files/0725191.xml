        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Book Review could better serve its readers if, instead of repeating platitudes about J. Philippe Rushton's right to be heard, it were to exercise its responsibility to examine what Mr. Rushton is saying. Malcolm W. Browne quotes Rushton apologists to the effect that "as science, there is nothing wrong with Rushton's work in principle." Nothing could be farther from the truth, as even a cursory examination of Mr. Rushton's publications reveals. The bulk of his controversial claims are published in journals that do not adhere to the standard scientific procedures of review and criticism by scientific colleagues.
