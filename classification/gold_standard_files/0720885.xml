        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Jim Holt's article on "The Bell Curve" (Op-Ed, Oct. 19) made a number of important biological points about race and intelligence. His perspective becomes even richer if we consider the context of our evolutionary history.</p>
        <p>Until about 150 years ago the vast majority of all people on all continents were illiterate subsistence agriculturists. Before 10,000 years ago we were all hunters and gatherers. The modern era has not existed long enough to cause genetic change.</p>
        <p>For the majority, pre-modern conditions probably did not require different levels of intelligence. And the tiny pre-modern literate elites were not independent breeding populations. In short, there is no evolutionary reason to expect genetic difference between races or classes.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, evidence from mitochondria DNA suggests that the line leading to present-day Asian populations split from the line leading to Africans and Europeans before Africans and Europeans split from each other. So if Europeans and Asians are more intelligent than Africans, increased intelligence would have had to evolve independently on two occasions, which is highly unlikely and very hard to explain.</p>
        <p>It seems odd that in the 19th century, when Europe dominated the world economy, whites scored higher than Asians on intelligence tests. According to "The Bell Curve," Asians are now smarter. So who was smartest in the ninth century A.D., Muslim Spaniards? In 4000 B.C., the Egyptians? I doubt we have evolved a mechanism that varies intelligence with gross national product in 50-year intervals.
