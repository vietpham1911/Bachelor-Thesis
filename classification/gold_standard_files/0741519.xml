        <p>And Bear in Mind (Editor's Choices of other recent books of particular interest) ADMITTING THE HOLOCAUST: Collected Essays, by Lawrence L. Langer. (Oxford University, $23.) Mr. Langer, a retired professor of English, illuminates the literature of the Holocaust -- the chronicles of ghetto and camp, the fiction and poetry wrought out of the horror, the representations in film and on television. Mr. Langer is also the editor of ART FROM THE ASHES: A Holocaust Anthology (Oxford University, $30), a remarkable collection of personal accounts, both by well-known survivors and by victims otherwise obscure, and of fiction, poetry and art related to the cataclysm.  ALL THE DAYS AND NIGHTS: The Collected Stories of William Maxwell. (Knopf, $25.) Stories, balanced, gentle and humane, concerned above all with reconciliation, from six decades of work by a master writer and editor who is now 86.  ANGEL ANGEL, by April Stevens. (Viking, $19.95.) A strangely persuasive novel about a family petrified by a father's desertion, then restored to humanity by an ebullient young woman with enough excess mental health to go around.  ANTARCTIC NAVIGATION, by Elizabeth Arthur. (Knopf, $25.) A first-person novel, alive with feeling and animated energy, whose heroine's aim is to vindicate by imitation the vision and morals of Scott of the Antarctic.  DEMOCRACY ON TRIAL, by Jean Bethke Elshtain. (Basic Books, $20.) A thoughtful professor of ethics argues that the weakness of democratic institutions in America reflects the replacement of rights conceived as immunities from government interference by rights conceived as individual entitlements.  FELICIA'S JOURNEY, by William Trevor. (Viking, $21.95.) Mr. Trevor's latest novel concerns an unmarried, pregnant, vulnerable Irish girl, wandering England's industrial Midlands until she encounters a predatory Englishman whose monstrosity remains long concealed.  THE GENERALS' WAR: The Inside Story of the Conflict in the Gulf, by Michael R. Gordon and Bernard E. Trainor. (Little, Brown, $27.95.) A lucid, meticulously researched report by the chief Pentagon correspondent of The New York Times and a retired general who is director of national security programs at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.  NIGHT: Night Life, Night Language, Sleep, and Dreams, by A. Alvarez. (Norton, $23.) Personal and literary explorations of the less visible (and therefore more conjectural) half of life by a gifted critic and acutely intuitive memoirist.  THE PAPERBOY, by Pete Dexter. (Random House, $23.) An eerie and beautiful novel whose emotionally alienated title character, a reporter in quest of facts only, is outmaneuvered by violent half-wits who know what they want.  REFLECTIONS OF EDEN: My Years With the Orangutans of Borneo, by Birute M.F. Galdikas. (Little, Brown, $24.95.) An offbeat personal memoir that examines her own life and work, by a woman who studied the most autonomous ape.</p>
