        <p>Charles Murray knows he treads on nonpolitically correct ground when he writes of genes and intellect. Proof of his theories is hard to come by and anecdotal evidence is not science.</p>
        <p>However, there is some history that might serve as a clinical trial to prove his thesis on a more scientific basis. He touched upon it when he paid the Israeli cellist the national compliment: "In terms of I.Q., you guys are off the charts."</p>

        <p>Charles Murray knows he treads on nonpolitically correct ground when he writes of genes and intellect. Proof of his theories is hard to come by and anecdotal evidence is not science.</p>
        <p>However, there is some history that might serve as a clinical trial to prove his thesis on a more scientific basis. He touched upon it when he paid the Israeli cellist the national compliment: "In terms of I.Q., you guys are off the charts."</p>
        <p>In Eastern European shtetls, the brightest youngsters spent their years in the yeshivas and the most promising one was matched to the rich man's daughter as the best catch. This allowed him to spend his life in study and sire a dozen children who followed in his footsteps. Do this for 2,000 years and you have some clinical results.</p>
        <p>While that was going on, the brightest Christian children were dedicated to the church and celibacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray, does this prove anything? HERMAN GROSS Great Neck, L.I.</p>
