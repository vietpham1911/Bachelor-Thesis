        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The authors of the three books reviewed by Malcolm W. Browne are to be commended on one insight they apparently share: that the growing gap between the higher-I.Q. upper classes and the lower-I.Q. "underclass" is deplorable. Beyond that, their brain cells seem to be lacking the serotonin needed to make some important intellectual connections. If I.Q.'s -- skewed as the tests may be -- can be increased even temporarily by Head Start, not to mention by good nutrition and housing, stable and caring homes, etc., surely there is more to nurture over nature than these scholars admit.</p>

        <p>I teach mostly inner-city African-Americans in a community college that many people with children and low-paying jobs make sacrifices to attend. Many of them are single women (black and white) who, as they admit in personal essays, have unplanned children who provide a kind of love and stability often lacking in their lives. Some of my students have survival skills and street smarts probably unassessable by I.Q. tests. Some have stunted imaginations, which bad environments can cause. And some are wiser than some college professors. ANN MORRISSETT DAVIDON  Philadelphia</p>
