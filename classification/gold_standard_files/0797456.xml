        <p>Two years ago Ruth Shalit, a writer for The New Republic, heard that Harvard Law School had bent its rules to favor a black professor. She was told that a law review article of his, required for tenure, had actually been written by the review's student editors.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shalit came up to Harvard and looked into the story. She found that it was false. The professor had written his article, and she saw the original draft.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, she wrote and the magazine published a piece on the matter. It quoted contemptuous comments on the professor that were said to have been made by unnamed students and faculty members. Then, two-thirds of the way through the article, Ms. Shalit told the readers that the charge against the professor was untrue. The whole thing was, she said, a "pseudo-scandal."</p>
        <p>Unethical journalism would be a mild description of that sordid episode: spreading the poison of a rumor and then acknowledging its falsity. Could it have happened if the professor had been of any other color or ethnic origin? Of course not. The tale was investigated and written on the premise that a black professor might indeed be inferior.</p>
        <p>That was a small example of what has become a flood of articles and books on the same premise: the likely inferiority of blacks. (The premise informs a recent article by Ms. Shalit on diversity in employment at The Washington Post. "If editors refuse to adjust their traditional hiring standards," she wrote, "they will end up with a nearly all-white staff." Her descriptions of particular black staff members as inferior were compellingly answered by Post executives.)</p>
        <p>A monument of the genre was last year's "The Bell Curve," by Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein, which argued that races differ in intellect and that heredity has much to do with the differences. Many scientists dismiss the book's statistical analysis as nonsense, but it has sold 400,000 copies.</p>
        <p>Now we have "The End of Racism," by Dinesh D'Souza. Mr. D'Souza rejects the genetic claim of "The Bell Curve." But he says black Americans have a distinctive and inferior culture -- and that, not discrimination on the basis of color, is the reason for their problems.</p>
        <p>A writer for the conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, Hugh Pearson, writing critically about the book, pointed to one passage as exemplifying the extremity of Mr. D'Souza's views: "If America as a nation owes blacks as a group reparations for slavery, what do blacks as a group owe America for the abolition of slavery?"</p>
        <p>The message is that blacks should not complain: They haven't really suffered all that much. Thus Mr. D'Souza argues that historically slavery was not racist, though it "developed a racist character" in America. And after slavery ended, the white South imposed segregation "to protect blacks."</p>
        <p>Another recent example of this message is a piece by Dwight D. Murphey in The Conservative Review. It is called "Issues in American History: Lynching in Perspective."</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphey notes that a few whites were lynched, too. He offers an explanation other than racism for the hundreds of blacks lynched: "The crime that was so widespread and outrageous" among them. In other words, they were guilty though not tried. It was their fault.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Souza's book has been widely criticized. But that has not affected his financial rewards; 100,000 copies are in print. That says a lot about what white Americans want to be told these days: that they should not be criticized for racism.</p>
        <p>The essential appeal of the Murray and D'Souza books lies there. They argue that white Americans have nothing to be ashamed of: If blacks have problems, it is their fault. Read this book, and stop worrying about your feelings toward blacks.</p>
        <p>Black Americans should be as subject to criticism as others. Our freedom cannot be based on political correctness.</p>
        <p>But Mr. D'Souza's generalized attempts to make whites feel good are pathetic. Can anyone doubt that slavery was racist in this country? Or that segregation branded blacks as inferior just as much as the yellow stars that the Nazis made Jews wear? Still, today, blacks suffer harassment and discrimination that the rest of us would surely find unbearable.</p>
