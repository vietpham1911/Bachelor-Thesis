LONDON, by John Russell. (Abrams, $45.) Not a guide but a personal survey and celebration by a fine critic who seems to know his hometown as much through osmosis as through industry.  UNDER MY SKIN: Volume One of My Autobiography, to 1949, by Doris Lessing. (HarperCollins, $25.) A remarkable life in a remarkable place -- the declining British Empire in Africa -- told by a novelist who for three-quarters of a century has conceded nothing to political, psychological or literary fashion.

The book Howe was working on at his death last year, a collection of freestanding essays on the art of fiction, is mainly a record of the pleasures of thinking, and thinking acutely, about novels.  DANCER WITH BRUISED KNEES, by Lynne McFall. (Chronicle, $18.95.)

FAMILY, by Ian Frazier. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $23.) An extraordinary history of an ordinary family, in which the author plays the roles of gossip, pedant and loyal member, yielding a reunion strangers are welcome -- and fortunate -- to attend.  THE FOLLOWING STORY, by Cees Nooteboom. (Helen and Kurt Wolff/Harcourt Brace, $14.95.) An insignificant man who has experienced transformation by imagination awaits his turn at death in this "Eurofable" by a Dutch novelist.  HIMMELFARB, by Michael Kruger. (Braziller, $18.50.)

LAST TRAIN TO MEMPHIS: The Rise of Elvis Presley, by Peter Guralnick. (Little, Brown, $24.95.) A meticulous marshaling of the facts about the ascendant career of a "real decent, fine boy" whose rise to the top (10 million singles for RCA in 11 months in 1955-56; he was 21) startled him as much as it did the rest of the country.  LONDON, by John Russell. (Abrams, $45.) Not a guide but a personal survey and celebration by a fine critic who seems to know his hometown as much through osmosis as through industry.  UNDER MY SKIN: Volume One of My Autobiography, to 1949, by Doris Lessing. (HarperCollins, $25.) A remarkable life in a remarkable place -- the declining British Empire in Africa -- told by a novelist who for three-quarters of a century has conceded nothing to political, psychological or literary fashion.  WINCHELL: Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity, by Neal Gabler. (Knopf, $30.) The life of Walter Winchell, inventor of the modern gossip column, who reached two-thirds of adult Americans in the 1940's and left behind him a national habit of confusing notoriety with news.</p>
