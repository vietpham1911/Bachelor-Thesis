        <p>THE DREAMS OUR STUFF IS MADE OF  How Science Fiction Conquered the World  By Thomas M. Disch  256 pages. The Free Press. $25.</p>
        <p>Science fiction ''has come to permeate our culture,'' writes Thomas M. Disch in his wide-ranging, appealingly titled new book, ''The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made of,'' which promises to explain, in the words of its subtitle, ''How Science Fiction Conquered the World.'' Mr. Disch continues, ''The dinosaurs in the movies look as real as elephants or camels; toddlers' toys morph into weapons; grown-ups on talk shows discuss their U.F.O. abductions, while on the next channel a dull documentary recounts the history of space exploration.''</p>
        <p>How did this come about? Mr. Disch, himself a prolific writer of science fiction, suggests any number of causes. What was once predicted by science fiction has now come to pass. The golden age for reading science fiction is 12, which is the mental age we as a nation have become. We are also ''a nation of liars, and for that reason science fiction has a special claim to be our national literature, as the art form best adapted to telling the lies we like to hear and to pretend we believe.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Disch's thesis is hard to pin down. Consider how he articulates another of his explanations: ''It is my contention that some of the most remarkable features of the present historical moment have their roots in a way of thinking that we have learned from science fiction.'' He then lists items like ''the razing of the Berlin wall,'' ''Madonna's wardrobe and Sinead O'Connor's hair style,'' ''celebrity murder trials'' and ''compassion 'burnout' for refugees in Rwanda.'' This makes a kind of sense on its surface, but the more you try to understand it exactly, the more you feel as if you were trying to pack a cloud into a trunk.</p>
        <p>The entire book suffers from this lack of clarity. In a chapter on voyages to the moon in literature, Mr. Disch will be discussing, say, H. G. Wells, when suddenly Wells's ''evolutionary subtext'' will get him onto ''The Bell Curve,'' by Charles Murray, whose thesis, Mr. Disch writes, ''dismays for the same reason that 'The Time Machine' and 'The Origin of Species' do: it suggests that human nature is not a God-given absolute, but an un-Platonic variable, the function of our malleable genes.''  This makes sense only if you don't ask where Mr. Disch is coming from or where he's going.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, his book presents a number of provocative points, so long as you don't try to connect the dots. In a chapter on Edgar Allan Poe as science fiction's ''essential ancestor,'' (not Mary Shelley, Mr. Disch insists, because her ''Frankenstein'' isn't read), he argues that the only real difference between Poe and T. S. Eliot is that the former is popular while the latter is elitist. In Chapter 4, ''How Science Fiction Defused the Bomb,'' he writes that ''unfortunately for would-be peacemakers, bombs -- and other weapons of all sorts -- have a built-in erotic component, and the atomic bomb, as the most powerful bomb of all time, has inspired almost everyone who has written about or made movies about it to represent it as a kind of aphrodisiac releasing the forces of the id.''</p>
        <p>In chapters on science fiction writers who are women and on science fiction as a religion, he accuses Ursula Le Guin of editing ''The Norton Book of Science Fiction'' ''to create an anthology that is a one-volume affirmative action campaign, remedying the genre's perceived historical neglect of women and other exemplary victims,'' and he calls L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, a ''capable con man'' and, in the words of one California judge, ''a pathological liar.''</p>
        <p>Along the way Mr. Disch manages to arouse one's interest in several books, like Joe Haldeman's novel, ''The Forever War,'' which Mr. Disch says ''is to the Vietnam War what 'Catch-22' was to World War II, the definitive, bleakly comic satire''; Joanna Russ's book ''The Female Man,'' which he says ''must be accounted the best feminist science-fiction novel of all time,'' and Hal Clement's ''Mission of Gravity,'' which he calls ''the best account of alien life on another planet that I'd  ever read.''</p>
        <p>But beware of trying to connect the dots. In his introduction, he writes, ''Science fiction is one of the few American industries that has never been transplanted abroad with any success.'' Then on page 69, he remarks that ''until the early 1950's, the English had a virtual monopoly on the writing of enduring science fiction.'' Later he says that in the 1960's Americans lost their fear of atomic warfare and that a major reason was that they were kidded out of it by Stanley Kubrick's film ''Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,''  both of which observations seem dubious.</p>
        <p>And in his final chapter, on what he sees as the dismal future of science-fiction publishing, he argues that ''those who enjoy fiction of whatever sort'' would ''rather see a tale being told than read it,'' adding, '' 'Hamlet' in a reasonably good stage production is more engaging than 'Hamlet' on the page.'' But ''Hamlet'' is a play, not a novel, and the best novels remain more fun to read than to see.</p>
        <p>Finally, ''The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of'' fails to explain what its subtitle promises, ''How Science Fiction Conquered the World.'' Instead it discusses the impact of the medium on our culture, but not very coherently. ''No blossoms wither so quickly as yesterday's tomorrows,''  Mr. Disch writes of science fiction's ephemeral nature. In the pages of this book, yesterday's tomorrows need some pruning and arranging.</p>
