        <p>If the Washington press corps had spent as much time getting to the bottom of Whitewater as it has trying to identify the author of "Primary Colors," our long national nightmare, the Alfonse D'Amato telethon, would be over.

        <p>If the Washington press corps had spent as much time getting to the bottom of Whitewater as it has trying to identify the author of "Primary Colors," our long national nightmare, the Alfonse D'Amato telethon, would be over.

Anonymous is someone who has an intimate knowledge of the '92 campaign, an intensely ambivalent relationship with Bill Clinton, a proven literary track record and a lot of time on his hands.  Who else could it be but Al Gore?</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, back at the best-seller list, there is another, more significant shift in our political culture that goes unremarked: the comeback of the liberal book. In this Sunday's Times Book Review -- in which "Primary Colors" hits the fiction list at number 7 -- the nonfiction list is topped by a one-two liberal punch, Hillary Rodham Clinton's "It Takes a Village" and Al Franken's "Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot." Further down are Bill Bradley's "Time Present, Time Past" and Jonathan Kozol's case for more, not less, social spending, "Amazing Grace."</p>
        <p>It was not even two years ago that liberal books were declared dead, as publishers raced to sign up any right-winger they could find. After the '94 G.O.P. landslide, runaway best sellers by Mr. Limbaugh, Dan Quayle, William Bennett and Charles Murray were seen in retrospect as auguries of the revolution.</p>
        <p>But the counterrevolution has arrived fast. Last Saturday at my local Barnes  &amp; Noble, Newt Gingrich's formerly best-selling "To Renew America" was stacked on the 50-percent-off table next to "Kato Kaelin: The Whole Truth." Dinesh D'Souza's "The End of Racism," tirelessly promoted as a controversial ideological companion piece to "The Bell Curve," never made the Times list. Neither have Mr. Gingrich's novel "1945," Mr. D'Amato's "Power, Pasta and Politics," Pat Robertson's "The End of the Age" or Ben Wattenberg's "Values Matter Most."</p>
        <p>"Telling the Truth," an attack on political correctness by Lynne Cheney, was  a "non-starter," according to one publishing executive -- despite its author's TV visibility as a Pat Buchanan wannabe on "Crossfire." This Sunday even Mr. Bennett, that cottage industry of virtue, falls off the list for the first time  in months.</p>
        <p>Is this an augury for Election Day '96? Al Franken says he's been taken aback by the velocity of his book's sales. "Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot" took off before a single ad ran, selling so fast that the publisher at first couldn't meet the demand. The book's contents include a review of the multi-married G.O.P. Presidential candidates' "family values," a Jewish infiltrator's no-holds-barred account of a Christian Coalition convention and a parody of Soldier of Fortune-style fiction in which the hawkish Vietnam non-veterans Mr. Limbaugh, Mr. Quayle, Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Buchanan, Phil Gramm, Clarence Thomas and George Will are found battling (or, more frequently, cowering) in the Central Highlands in an "Operation Chickenhawk" commanded by Oliver North.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franken feels his book has benefited by its timing, which coincides with  rising anger at the Republican Congressional leadership. "These guys have shown  their colors," he said, "and they're in retreat now." Mr. Limbaugh seems to be in retreat, too. Mr. Franken's publisher sent the broadcaster his book two months ago, with a letter saying "Al thinks it will help sales if you mention the book on the show." Mr. Limbaugh has yet to rise to the bait, and, in still another sign of anti-conservative backlash, may have a waning promotional usefulness anyway.  Nielsen computes that his TV ratings have dipped by 20 percent since last season.</p>
        <p>An even better cultural gauge of resurgent liberalism is Mrs. Clinton's book, which, as a rival publisher observes, may be purchased more as "a vote of affirmation" of the Clintons during their Whitewater travails than for its views, unexceptional as they are, on motherhood. If it takes a village to raise  a child, it takes some No-Doz to get through Mrs. Clinton's policy-wonking. But  the customers don't seem to care.</p>
        <p>Can conservatives get back on the board by Election Day? Mr. Quayle, Robert Bork and Ralph Reed all have books coming out soon. But the best hope for a G.O.P. literary comeback might be a tell-all book by another Anonymous. "Enid and Joe Waldholtz Are Big Fat Idiots," perhaps?</p>
