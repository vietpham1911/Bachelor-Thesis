        <p>IN 1751, CIVIC LEADERS OF Philadelphia asked authorities to charter the colonies' first mental hospital. The main concern, wrote Benjamin Franklin, was the growing number of "lunatics" who "going at large are a terror to their neighbors, who are daily apprehensive of the violences they may commit."</p>
        <p>Have things come full circle? A sense of historical cycles comes through repeatedly in the new exhibition "Madness in America: Cultural and Medical Perceptions of Mental Illness Before 1914." An exploration of how changing ideas resonated among science, culture and art, the 60-odd items in this compact show, gathered from far-flung sources, are on view at the New York Academy of Sciences and the New York Academy of Medicine, until Dec. 30.</p>
        <p>The subject is a rich one, telling as much about the anxieties of society as about the nature of mental disease. Nearly every one of the items on display -- including engravings, photographs and paintings depicting aspects of insanity as well as related medical drawings, texts and gadgets, all with detailed explanatory labels -- tells a pungent story. Organized by Lynn Gamwell, director of the art museum of the State University of New York at Binghampton, the exhibit ranges beyond mental illness to examine theories of intelligence, race, sex roles and homosexuality.</p>
        <p>The starting point is Franklin's day, the Age of Enlightenment, when humans were exalted for their Reason. The lack of it could only make one subhuman, a beast. Those labeled lunatics were often chained and kept in virtual cages, as revealed in art of the era, like an 1806 engraving by Sir Charles Bell showing a chained, animal-like man as the essence of madness. At Pennsylvania Hospital, the one Franklin helped start, attendants were called keepers and a curious public was allowed to come gawk at the inmates.</p>
        <p>A more enlightened if naive approach arose in the 19th century, holding that humane confinement could nurture a return of reason. Asylums borrowed from the Romantic movement the idea of nature as healer; inmates were sometimes shown the dramatic painted landscapes of the era in magic-lantern shows.</p>
        <p>As part of the newly "normal" atmosphere, asylums began to hold dances for patients and staff. The "lunatic's ball" became a special object of public fascination, depicted frequently in art and magazines, as in an 1865 weekly publication, with an illustration of a dance in a New York City asylum. This intense interest, too, Ms. Gamwell suggests, may reflect the influence of the Romantics, who were intrigued by the notion of deranged people dancing with abandon.</p>
        <p>By the late 19th century, with treatment results disappointing and state asylums degenerating into vile warehouses, a movement arose to de-institutionalize the afflicted, part of a cycle of greater and lesser confinement that has continued -- with mental hospitals largely emptied in recent decades, putting many schizophrenics on the street and prompting new demands to force some of the most helpless or dangerous back into hospitals.</p>
        <p>The curator found, as Ken Burns did in exploring baseball's past, that racism is an unavoidable theme when studying any topic in social history. In the mid-19th century, the new industrial civilization was seen as a cause of mental disorders, but only for the refined, large-cortex minds of evolution's highest form, the white person. Less advanced peoples, prominent doctors said, were more likely to lose their minds when confronted with political freedom.</p>
        <p>The exhibit shows how creatively science was used to paint blacks as inferior. This was especially common after the Civil War, when the new legal equality of blacks led to intense efforts to show mental differences.</p>
        <p>Viewers may think twice before again using the terms "highbrow" and "lowbrow" culture. These terms originated with studies and drawings, included in the show, purporting to show that whites had higher foreheads to accommodate a larger cerebral cortex, while blacks had lower brows and a smaller cortex. Anthropologists later showed that the angle of the forehead varies within all groups, and that brain size is linked to body size, not to race or intelligence. After World War I, debate on intelligence shifted from spurious analysis of physical traits to the new science of I.Q., where it remains, flaring anew this year with the publication of "The Bell Curve," by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray.</p>
        <p>The minds of women, too, were scrutinized in revealing ways. In 1854, one Dr. Joseph R. Buchanan applied the pseudoscience of phrenology, which linked regions of the brain to character traits, to the entire female body. Marking off his discoveries on a drawing of a Greek statue, on view in the show, he pinpointed the "region of virtue" in the upper chest, the "region of insanity" in the pelvic area.</p>
        <p>Another doctor compiled a list of the chief causes of insanity in male and female patients. Among those for men were intemperance, stock speculation and masturbation. Women would never perform the third, of course, but some were driven mad by tight lacing of the corset.</p>
        <p>Those with aberrant life styles could easily be confined as crazy. Lucy Ann Lobdell, born in upstate New York in 1829, was a skilled hunter and lived off the land with a female companion. Photographs of her from the 1870's are in the show; as the labels explain, she was eventually jailed as a pauper, then committed on three grounds: she insisted on wearing male attire, she called herself a huntress, and she threatened violence to herself and others. Researchers have found no evidence to back up the latter assertion, but she spent her last 32 years in a New York state asylum.</p>
        <p>SURVIVORS OF THE 1980'S ART market, as well as students of American painting, may particularly enjoy one item. In 1899 the landscape artist Ralph Albert Blakelock, not yet the hot commodity he became a decade or two later, was found wandering the streets of New York, tearing up money, after having accepted an insultingly low price for a painting.</p>
        <p>He lived out his life in a state hospital, filled with delusions of great wealth. In 1913 one of his early landscapes sold at auction for $13,900, then the highest price for a living American artist. But he and his family did not benefit. In the asylum, he painted small landscapes in the shape of bills, some marked with large denominations. Ms. Gamwell has tracked down three previously unshown "bills" that Blakelock handed to a visiting collector in 1916, telling him he could live off them. In Blakelock's obviously deranged mind, it would seem, the melding of art and money was total.  ART</p>
