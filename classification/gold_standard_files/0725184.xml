        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A few days after you published Malcolm W. Browne's quite favorable review of three new books that attribute intelligence primarily to genetic factors, I came across a discussion of intelligence testing in William Broad and Nicholas Wade's 1982 book, "Betrayers of the Truth." Mr. Broad and Mr. Wade list "three cardinal principles" for the use of intelligence tests, as laid down by the tests' inventor, Alfred Binet: "Binet's Rule 1 was: The scores do not define anything innate or permanent. Rule 2: The scale is a rough guide for identifying and helping learning-disabled children; it is not a way of measuring normal children. Rule 3: Low scores don't mean a child is innately incapable."</p>

        <p>Mr. Broad and Mr. Wade charge that these rules "were systematically ignored and perverted" by Binet's "American imitators." To judge from the books discussed by Mr. Browne, these rules are still being ignored, if not perverted, by some American (and Canadian) scientists who claim to be Binet's intellectual heirs.
