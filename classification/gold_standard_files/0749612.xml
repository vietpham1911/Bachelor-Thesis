        <p>THE debate over abortion has been a fault line in American life for more than two decades, separating friend from friend, feminist from fundamentalist, Democrat from Republican -- and increasingly, Republican from Republican.</p>
        <p>But now a dispute about what consequences proposed welfare revisions portend for abortion threatens not only to splinter conservative Republicans but to strain their ties to traditional allies like the Catholic Church and the National Right to Life Committee. The dispute also is creating common ground for new partnerships.</p>
        <p>Opposition to abortion has long been a basic tenet of conservative Republicans. So has indignation over the rise in teen pregnancy and the number of babies being born to unmarried women who depend on welfare to support them. Until recently, both views co-existed relatively peaceably under the Family Values banner.</p>
        <p>Conservatives now face a conundrum. The bill being advanced by House Republicans would deny Federal cash assistance for babies born to unmarried girls under 18, or to mothers who are already getting welfare at the time of the birth or mothers who had received benefits any time in the previous 10 months.</p>
        <p>Should the conservatives commit themselves to reining in welfare? Should they try to stem the tide of births to unwed teen-agers by ensuring that poor women will get no financial reward for giving birth too young or too often? And will that just encourage more young women to have abortions?</p>
        <p>Two Can't Live as Cheaply</p>
        <p>Several Republican Congressmen -- including some who signed on to House Speaker Newt Gingrich's Contract With America, which featured this welfare revision -- now say they cannot reconcile the welfare changes with their opposition to abortion.</p>
        <p>"I've been in the pro-life movement for 20 years, and I know there is overwhelming data that financial pressures are one of the main reasons some women have abortions," said Representative Christopher H. Smith, the New Jersey Republican who is co-chairman of the House Pro-Life Caucus. "I can't vote for something that's going to tip women toward abortion."</p>
        <p>Even some proponents of the proposed welfare cutoff acknowledge that, at least in the short run, it would cause more abortions.</p>
        <p>"Whether this is good depends on what one thinks of abortion," Charles Murray said last summer. Mr. Murray is co-author of "The Bell Curve" (The Free Press, 1994), which theorizes that society is stratified by I.Q., which is based in part on genetic endowment.</p>
        <p>Last month, Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, said his group would not support the Republican national ticket in 1996 unless the party's candidates oppose abortion. But Mr. Reed, like many conservatives, favors the welfare revisions anyway. He said his priority is to end the "culture of illegitimacy."</p>
        <p>Long Run vs. Short Term</p>
        <p>And William Kristol, the conservative strategist who heads the Project for the Republican Future, says the party will not be riven by the dispute. "At the end of the day, it's not a big issue because in the long run, an attack on illegitimacy is an attack on promiscuity is an attack on abortion," he said. "We can't not reform welfare because it might lead to a few more abortions. And I do think there's a plausible argument that the reforms might discourage teen-agers from sexual activity, and therefore reduce the number of abortions."</p>
        <p>But for some, the welfare proposal has become a watershed. Last month, the National Right to Life News featured a front-page headline, "Welfare 'Reforms' Pose Threat to Unborn Babies."</p>
        <p>"If we were to stand silently by and not have the courage to speak out against these proposals, then we could never look anyone in the eye again and say we support alternatives to abortion," said Wanda Franz, president of the National Right to Life Committee.</p>
        <p>"This is not a little blip," said Helen Alvare, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. "This has to do with the basic pro-life commitment of the Republican party. We grant the goodwill of those seeking to end the culture of teen parenting. But we cannot seek a good end by evil means. We must not penalize innocent children by cutting off their support because their mother was too young, or has other children on welfare. And we cannot take action that will push more women toward abortion."</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith is offering an amendment to allow states to give vouchers for diapers and other baby needs to women already on welfare. Representative Jim Bunn -- a freshman from Oregon who refused to sign the Contract with America last year because he feared the welfare cutoffs would encourage abortion -- would let states give cash to the parents of teen mothers who live at home and remain in school, or vouchers to those who do not live with their parents but are still in school.</p>
        <p>Strange Bedfellows</p>
        <p>Kim Gandy, executive vice president of the National Organization for Women, which is working with conservative groups that oppose the welfare cutoffs, said of her old abortion foes (and new allies): "This is the first time in my memory that they've been involved in anything for children after birth."</p>
        <p>In January, the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a non-profit research group, warned that welfare cutoffs would place the Federal Government in a "truly indefensible position" by denying funds for abortion, encouraging pregnant women on Medicaid to have babies they could not afford to support and then punishing them by denying benefits for the children.</p>
        <p>Liberals say the Government should finance abortions for low-income women who want them, provide welfare benefits for those raising their babies and increase funding for family-planning services.</p>
        <p>"In the whole debate over teen pregnancy and welfare reform, no one is talking about increasing access to family planning and abortion," said Jacqueline Darroch Forrest, research director of the Guttmacher Institute. The issues are connected, she said, and "if we want to reduce teen pregnancy and abortions, we need to do more with contraception."</p>
        <p>As campaign agendas are being hammered into legislation, the connections and contradictions are being brought home to conservatives, too.</p>
        <p>"Teenage mothers killing their own babies is not welfare reform," said Mr. Bunn, the Oregon congressman. "This is definitely the hardest issue for me so far. It's great to be part of a Republican majority, trying to move through a lot of things I think are critically important, but I think my friends are making a mistake on this, and I won't be a part of it."</p>
