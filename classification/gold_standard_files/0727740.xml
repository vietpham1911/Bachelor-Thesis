        <p>And Bear in Mind (Editor's Choices of other recent books of particular interest) THE BOOK OF INTIMATE GRAMMAR, by David Grossman. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $22.)

CORELLI'S MANDOLIN, by Louis de Bernieres. (Pantheon, $24.) A high-spirited historical romance about events on a Greek island, mostly during World War II, when Italians and Germans occupy the place and try to control it.  FAMILY, by Ian Frazier. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $23.) An extraordinary history of an ordinary family, in which the author plays the roles of gossip, pedant and loyal member, yielding a reunion strangers are welcome -- and fortunate -- to attend.  FEELING THE SPIRIT: Searching the World for the People of Africa, by Chester Higgins Jr. (Bantam, $50.) Wonderfully evocative images of Africans and their descendants everywhere, by a staff photographer at The New York Times.  THE LAST SHOT: City Streets, Basketball Dreams, by Darcy Frey. (Richard Todd/Houghton Mifflin, $19.95.) Mr. Frey examines the myth of deliverance through basketball on the courts of Coney Island, where black youths compete to be exploited by coaches, colleges and, in the rarest cases, by professional sports.  LOST PURITAN: A Life of Robert Lowell, by Paul Mariani. (Norton, $27.50.) This approach to the "real" character of a protean confessional poet uses letters and diaries to reveal a writer whose fascination with preachers, statesmen and generals hints at restlessness with his own art.  THE MASTER OF PETERSBURG, by J.M. Coetzee. (Viking, $21.95.) The hero of Mr. Coetzee's grimmest novel yet is Dostoyevsky himself, trapped in generational and political clashes, trying to scrape meaning from the death of a son.  SEARCHING FOR MERCY STREET: My Journey Back to My Mother, Anne Sexton, by Linda Gray Sexton. (Little, Brown, $22.95.) An intimate account of growing up the daughter of a mad, child-abusing, suicidal, brilliant poet, and of resolving such an upbringing from the inside out.  SHADOWS OF THE MIND: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness, by Roger Penrose. (Oxford University, $25.) Mr. Penrose's assertion that only a new physics will explain mental life has been questioned, but he produces a fine introduction to quantum mechanics and what he thinks is wrong with it.  THIS YEAR IN JERUSALEM, by Mordecai Richler. (Knopf, $23.) An engaging novelist's report on his youth as a Zionist and his travels in Israel, ventures that leave him content to be a Canadian.  UNDER MY SKIN: Volume One of My Autobiography, to 1949, by Doris Lessing. (HarperCollins, $25.) A remarkable life in Britain's declining African empire, told by a novelist who has never conceded anything to political, psychological or literary fashion.</p>
