        <p>Within easy reach in the green canvas backpack that Karen Sumberg carries to high school is a pocket-size daily planner that helps her track all the assignments, volunteer activities, projects and club meetings that are crammed into every free hour.</p>
        <p>Ever since sixth grade, Karen's daily life has been circumscribed by all she must do to reach her self-imposed goal of getting into a top-tier college. "You are always asking yourself, 'Are they going to like this or that?' " said Karen, a sophomore, as she strode across the marble foyer of Temple Beth El, in Norwalk, where she spends Sunday mornings as a religious-school aide.</p>
        <p>By 1 P.M. she was ladling fruit salad at a soup kitchen. Later she rushed home to change for a swim club awards dinner, at which she was honored as co-captain of the senior team (sportsmanship wins points on a college application, too). Many evenings she practices her vocabulary skills on a computer in the family room. Last summer, she completed an S.A.T. prep course at Wellesley College. She has joined a Model United Nations debating club and has even taken up rowing.</p>
        <p>"I want to go where I want to go," Karen said. "I don't want to settle for where I can get in. And the schools look for these things. Grades alone aren't going to do it."</p>
        <p>Determined? Yes. Unusual? No. Getting into an increasingly rarefied list of the nation's most prestigious colleges, once a status symbol, is now perceived as a survival issue by families who see a future dogged by diminished opportunities, a stagnant economy and heightened global competition. And more students from places and circumstances where the Ivy League once seemed too remote are competing for all they're worth.</p>
        <p>"You have to do more than be a good student," said Jennifer Hong, 15, of Dunwoody, Ga., who has joined the Future Business Leaders of America even though she intends to be a pediatrician.</p>
        <p>The Ivy-or-bust mentality is evolving as a defining issue from earliest childhood. It haunts the games students play, the vacations plans they make, relationships with parents and friends and even the sports they choose.</p>
        <p>Harvard University was deluged with a record 18,000 applications for the 1,600 places for men and women entering in 1995, up 50 percent from 12,000 applications in 1990. The University of Pennsylvania was similarly swamped with 15,000 applications this year, compared with 10,600 five years ago. Applications to Princeton University have also climbed, from 12,600 in 1990 to 14,200 for 1995. All three universities say the odds have never been tougher.</p>
        <p>The amount of down time in these youngsters' lives is disappearing rapidly. The two largest national tutoring services that focus on S.A.T. preparation, Kaplan Educational Centers and the Princeton Review, each enrolled more than 30,000 student in their after-school classes in 1994, almost double the number of five years earlier. In the last five years, Kaplan has added 1,000 satellite classrooms to its 150 learning centers as demand has grown from Tullahoma, Tenn., to Minot, N.D., said Jonathan Grayer, the president of Kaplan.</p>
        <p>And the demand for their services is coming at an ever-earlier age. Three years ago, the Princeton Review introduced a junior level, for grades 7 through 10. More than 5,000 now attend.</p>
        <p>"Parents are asking us for S.A.T. prep even for our eighth and ninth graders," said Marcia Evans, president of Academic Study Associates in Armonk, N.Y., a company that provides summer enrichment programs at five universities. Duke University, a pioneer in summer programs for the mathematically gifted, today serves about 6,000 children a year.</p>
        <p>College expectations are even redefining the hot sports. "You see kids giving up baseball for lacrosse," said an 18-year-old from Wilton High School in Wilton, Conn., who asked that her name not be used. Lacrosse, she says, often leads to big Ivy League scholarships. Crew is another popular choice, because it is seen as an easy way to stand out.</p>
        <p>The pressure to succeed is also touching the lives of the very youngest children. Educational toys have become the fastest-growing category in the industry, according to Playthings magazine, a monthly trade journal. Stores like Egghead Software have entire shelves of products for toddlers.</p>
        <p>The emphasis on beating the competition is so profound even in kindergarten and first grade that children think they must win all the prizes "just to feel 'good enough,' " said Maria Alba-Fisch, a child psychologist in Mount Kisco, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The regular rankings of colleges by U.S. News and World Report and Money magazine, plus "The Bell Curve," the recently best-selling book by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray (Free Press, 1994) about America's intellectual elite, have contributed to the angst. So has the latest boomlet in the birthrate, called the baby boom echo, plus the rising cost of an undergraduate degree, which can now top $100,000.</p>
        <p>Educational counselors have found that parents are reluctant to spend a huge sum on a college without a prestigious name. But the pressure can "drive a wedge" between parents and their children when it starts too soon, because the children can't always see the point, warned John Katzman, president of the Princeton Review.</p>
        <p>Antoinette Saunders, a clinical psychologist working with children in Wilmette, Ill., warned of increased rebellion and resentment and even drug or alcohol abuse among less able children.</p>
        <p>Many parents say it is a no-win situation. "It's the way we give our children the very best chance for their future," said Toni Peebler, a Manhattan mother of a 14-year-old son. "The child might be more relaxed if the pressure were off. But try being the only boy in a class of 20 who didn't get into the Harvards of the world. It's not only their future but their self-worth that's in jeopardy."</p>
        <p>Others argue that a busy schedule is healthy. "Being involved in a multitude of activities has helped Karen find her strengths," said Ilene Sumberg, in Norwalk. But what about the stress? "When we think she's going into overload, we talk about where she can pull back," Mrs. Sumberg said. "It's a way to learn priorities." Karen says she is learning to become an efficient time manager, adding that it helps her enjoy her tight schedule rather than resent it.</p>
        <p>Anwar Bennett, 15, of Decatur, Ga., who has set his sights on either Cornell or Vanderbilt, lets out the tension by playing soccer or golf. Yet, he sounded melancholy as he recalled the fun of being the "class clown," a role he relished until ninth grade, when his parents sent him to parochial school and private after-school tutoring. Things had to change, he said, because "as a black youth, you're afraid you'll get even less opportunities if you don't get into a good school."</p>
        <p>The cutthroat college competition can warp friendships. "If you get a really good grade in math, then everyone else in the class gets mad at you," a student observed at a focus group in Wilton on college pressures. Betsy Kahan, a clinical psychologist in Wilton and a former consultant to the town's public schools, said it was particularly tough for a successful girl to develop relationships with boys who viewed her as a competitor.</p>
        <p>To keep friends and appearances, "kids lie to each other about their grades and their scores," said Amanda Rose, executive director of Stanford Coaching, a Manhattan service that provides private tutors. Typically, she said, a child will call a friend to find out how much time has been spent studying for a test. The friend, who may have been working for six hours, may say, "Only half an hour," to prevent the other from doing as well.  Lisa Jacobson, president of the company, knows youngsters who do "all nighters" with their books and coffee.</p>
        <p>The top colleges insist that they're not to blame and that the panic emanates from rising applications and wider economic concerns. "We're hearing it's statistically much harder to get into the right kindergarten in some cities," said William Fitzsimmons, Harvard's dean of admissions.</p>
        <p>Yet, the pressure to excel may also be coming from a change in attitude toward financial aid by the colleges. At a conference on higher education held last month at Spelman College in Atlanta, one paper reported a nationwide shift toward basing financial aid on merit. "So extra-curricular activities have to be even more impressive," said Alison R. Bernstein, director of the educational and cultural program at the Ford Foundation and a former associate dean of the faculty at Princeton. And this, she added, will further separate the rich and poor. "You will lose a lot of kids whose parents can't give them that extra leg up."</p>
        <p>Claire Gaudiani, president of Connecticut College, says that ivy has crowded people's vision too much. "Ninety-eight percent of our 1993 graduates have gone on to graduate school or are employed," she said. "The Fortune 500 companies actively recruit on campus, and we see starting salaries in the $40,000-to-50,000 range."</p>
        <p>But Ms. Jacobson said, "You can say to a child, 'Don't worry, it doesn't matter where you go,' but with all the peer pressure and hype, the kids won't believe you."</p>
        <p>She urges parents to remove themselves from the "me too" trap and to show a child, through specific examples, that many roads lead to success in life. "Otherwise," Ms. Jacobson said, "those children may never know the sheer joy of just being a kid."</p>
