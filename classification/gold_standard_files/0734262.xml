        <p>DOWNTOWN -- Catherine and Charlotte Forbes, granddaughters of the late Malcolm Forbes, were the lead debutantes at last Thursday's International Debutante Ball. On Wednesday, they were standing next to their fathers receiving guests at the Forbes Galleries on lower Fifth Avenue at a black-tie cocktail party.</p>
        <p>"She's smart enough to see eye to eye with me," Malcolm Forbes Jr., the writer and the president of Forbes Inc., said of his daughter, Catherine, who works as an intern at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.</p>

        <p>DOWNTOWN -- Catherine and Charlotte Forbes, granddaughters of the late Malcolm Forbes, were the lead debutantes at last Thursday's International Debutante Ball. On Wednesday, they were standing next to their fathers receiving guests at the Forbes Galleries on lower Fifth Avenue at a black-tie cocktail party.</p>
        <p>"She's smart enough to see eye to eye with me," Malcolm Forbes Jr., the writer and the president of Forbes Inc., said of his daughter, Catherine, who works as an intern at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.</p>
        <p>"It's where Charles Murray wrote 'The Bell Curve,' " said Ms. Forbes, who is researching the effect of religion on politics.</p>
        <p>"I guess she's rebelling against political correctness," said her father, looking pleased with himself.</p>
        <p>Next to them, Charlotte Forbes, an art history student at Princeton, was standing with her father, Christopher (Kip) Forbes, the vice chairman of Forbes. Christopher Forbes, who has written books about art, also studied art history at Princeton.</p>
        <p>"She doesn't want any of my old term papers," he said.</p>
        <p>Given the family collection, which includes Faberge eggs, Victorian art and other gilded objects from the last century, it seems efficient for father and daughter to share a special interest in 19th-century art. Last year, they toured some Russian palaces together.</p>
        <p>"Catherine the Great's taste was a little outlandish for us, but when we got to Alexander I, we were home free," Mr. Forbes said, adding that he and Charlotte, who wore a re-creation of a 19th-century gown at the ball, diverge in taste only slightly.</p>
        <p>"My father prefers French Empire furniture and I prefer Victorian," Ms. Forbes said. Clearly, the apples have not fallen far from the trees. In fact, it seems as if they haven't fallen at all.</p>
        <p>UPTOWN -- Last Wednesday, rush hour traffic outside the Equitable Building on Seventh Avenue was assaulting the ears. But inside the Equitable Gallery, where music boxes were on view in "The Music Box Project," soothing melodies embroidered the edges of silence.</p>
        <p>"It's been really busy today," said Anna Abdon, the soft-spoken young docent in white gloves who had just spent seven hours gently guiding groups of visitors from one music box to the next. As the only person in the room allowed to wind up the boxes, she was endowed with a certain power.</p>
        <p>"Naturally, people want to touch them," said Ms. Abdon, an art history student at Jersey City State College. "I tell them they can't, and I'm not wearing these white gloves for my health."</p>
        <p>It would be hard to imagine a more perfect music-box guide than Ms. Abdon, who thinks that "docent" is just a ritzy word for volunteer and is young enough to remember the childhood trauma of breaking her own Snow White music box.</p>
        <p>She gives a quick, thorough introduction to each piece, winds it up with delicate precision, then steps back respectfully and allows it to play. She leans against a wall, her white-gloved hands at her side. She doesn't yawn, look at her watch or distract in any way.</p>
        <p>If asked, she can tell you that Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson attended the exhibition's opening in November. Or that John Cage's 12 "Extended Lullaby" boxes were built in plexiglass cases to his specifications. She might even inform you that "Someday My Prince Will Come," which tinkles from inside a pocket of the artist Vito Acconci's wearable plastic vest, was a favorite song from her childhood.</p>
        <p>"This piece is by Nam June Paik," she said about an old television set showing a mesmerizing close-up of a music-box mechanism turning slowly.</p>
        <p>"It feels like my yoga class," one visitor said. Another said: "It's like a yule log. You could make a video of this and play it to go to sleep at night."</p>
        <p>Ms. Abdon smiled. "It's funny," she said, after her visitors had wandered off. "People stand here staring at this for a long time and get this glazed look in their eyes." Then she lowered her voice. "Sometimes I think about pushing them over."</p>
        <p>DOWNTOWN -- Bob Kingdom, the talented Welsh actor who is playing the talented drinkers Truman Capote and Dylan Thomas in two solo shows at the Perry Street Theater, had just finished performing "The Truman Capote Talk Show" on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>He guessed that neither Mr. Capote, who once stayed at the Beekman Tower Hotel because he was too drunk to cross the street to his apartment, and Mr. Thomas, who was kicked out of the Beekman for drunkenness and sent to the Chelsea Hotel ("where that sort of thing was encouraged," Mr. Kingdom said), weren't impressed with New Year's drunks.</p>
        <p>"New Year's Eve is for amateurs," Mr. Kingdom said. "And drinking was a serious business for those two. People used to go around looking for Dylan Thomas because he told great stories when he was drunk. But on New Year's, everyone else is hogging the stage. The seduction is that the booze is part of the talent. But drinking is drinking, and any fool can do it."</p>
        <p>Mr. Kingdom, who has given up alcohol and cigarettes, didn't have any New Year's resolutions. "I guess I could resolve to lose weight," he said. "I'm a chubby Dylan Thomas, but then again, I'm also a thin Truman Capote."  THE NIGHT</p>
