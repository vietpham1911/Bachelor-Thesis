        <p>"The Bell Curve," a flame-throwing treatise on race, class and intelligence by the late Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray advances a grisly thesis: I.Q., largely inherited and intractable, dictates an individual's success -- an economic death knell for much of America's black population. The story has America increasingly divided by race and sliding inexorably into castes based on I.Q.</p>
        <p>The book has already ignited bitter controversy, and that is no surprise. It declares settled what many regard as an unresolved argument over whether I.Q.'s have scientific merit. Moreover, Mr. Murray's record as a political ideologue who uses social science data to support his policy preferences touches a tender spot in American intellectual history on the issue of race and intelligence.</p>
        <p>The notion that one group could be genetically superior to another has a long and sordid history in this country and abroad. Bigots purported to find "scientific" evidence that blacks, or American Indians, or Jews, to name three targets, were of inferior stock. Even supposedly objective scholars lent their talents to such racism.</p>
        <p>Individual readers can judge the authors' racial attitudes and data. The concern here is the governmental fallout of a book that aspires to set the agenda of social policy debate for the decade. What gives their sweeping generalities poignancy is an overlay of sophisticated statistical tools that create an aura of scientific certitude sure to intimidate ordinary citizens from challenging the alarming conclusions.</p>
        <p>That would be tragic. Though "The Bell Curve" contains serious scholarship, it is also laced with tendentious interpretation. Once unlike-minded scholars have time to react, they will subject its findings to withering criticism. At its best, the Herrnstein-Murray story is an unconvincing reading of murky evidence. At its worst, it is perniciously and purposely incendiary. The graphs, charts, tables and data admit of less dire conclusions. But less dire would not have put Mr. Murray on the cover of news magazines, though it would have given America's disadvantaged a more accurate, hopeful glimpse of their future.</p>
        <p>The authors argue that there is an underlying core to intelligence, separate from individual talents or skills, that is well measured by I.Q. tests. I.Q. scores are largely inherited and after childhood immutable. In their view, high I.Q. leads to high income and respectable behavior. Low I.Q. leads to social pathology -- poverty, welfare dependency, out-of-wedlock births and crime.</p>
        <p>The book says low-I.Q. parents produce large families, dragging average I.Q.'s lower. Its authors belabor the well-known fact that the average I.Q. of blacks is 15 points below that of whites and dismiss arguments that these low test scores reflect little more than biased testing. Their implication is that blacks are trapped at the bottom of society.</p>
        <p>But many experts reject these chilling conclusions. For starters, the authors' statistical techniques are insufficiently powerful to distinguish the impact of I.Q. from talents or skills, some of which can be taught. Here, terminology matters. Were Mr. Murray parading around town with a story about skills, he would sound like everyone else who has tried to explain the explosive increase in income inequality in the last two decades. By blaming low I.Q. for poverty, he makes remediation look silly; by blaming skills for poverty, he would have invited society to try. The first finding is obviously the more attractive for Mr. Murray, who has built his career on arguing for the elimination of social programs.</p>
        <p>The authors give short shrift to explanations for low I.Q. scores that are less bleak than their own. Some remedial programs have raised I.Q.'s, even if temporarily. I.Q.'s for blacks, as well as whites, are moving higher over time. Black educational achievement is catching up. And other countries do a better job integrating minorities in the economic mainstream than the U.S. does. One of the authors' key measures of innate intelligence, scores on the military's qualifying test, has been shown to be a product of education, an environmental factor. The issue is balanced interpretation. Mr. Murray has created an act of advocacy; he has not built a scientific case.</p>
        <p>"The Bell Curve" presumes, but does not prove, that differences in genes account for 60 percent of the differences in the I.Q.'s of children. It is essential to note -- which the authors do but many of their critics do not -- that group differences in I.Q. may have nothing to do with genes even if individual I.Q.'s are largely inherited. An example proves the point. Plants grown together under ideal conditions will achieve different heights based solely on individual genetic makeup. But lock half the plants in a dark closet and the difference in average height of the two groups will be due entirely to environment. So even if I.Q.'s are deemed to be largely inherited, that says nothing about the potential impact on I.Q. of altering prenatal care or aggressive early education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray's findings are not wrong because they are ugly. They are wrong because they blind us to more compelling interpretations and because they ignore the huge gaps in understanding the precise nature of intelligence. What is right about the book was already well known: skills have taken on increasing importance in the economy and they are difficult to acquire. What is new about the book -- the fixation on genes as destiny -- is surely unproved and almost surely wrong: programs here and abroad produce measurable, if unspectacular, results. These sobering lessons were clear before "The Bell Curve" was published. They remain so afterward.</p>
