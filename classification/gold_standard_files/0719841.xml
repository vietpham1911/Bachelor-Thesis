        <p>And Bear in Mind (Editor's Choices of other recent books of particular interest) THE BELL CURVE: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life, by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray. (Free Press, $30.) The evidence the authors see indicates to them that society is layered in rough accordance with I.Q. and that I.Q. is largely heritable, findings they believe society needs to take note of.

An insignificant man who has experienced transformation by imagination awaits his turn at death in this "Eurofable" by a Dutch novelist. IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS, by Tim O'Brien.

THE PHYSICS OF IMMORTALITY: Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead, by Frank J. Tipler. (Doubleday, $24.95.)

STALIN AND THE BOMB: The Soviet Union and Atomic Energy, 1939-1956, by David Holloway. (Yale University, $30.)

(Richard Todd/Houghton Mifflin, $21.95.) This generous novel concerns abandonment, dislocation and the recovery of community in a Memphis bar whose owner is a surrogate parent to two displaced teen-agers. WHAT I LIVED FOR, by Joyce Carol Oates. (William Abrahams/Dutton, $23.95.)

WHO WILL RUN THE FROG HOSPITAL? by Lorrie Moore. (Knopf, $20.) A sad, witty, disillusioned fairy tale whose heroine, approaching 40, recalls the illusion of limitless possibility she used to feel.</p>
