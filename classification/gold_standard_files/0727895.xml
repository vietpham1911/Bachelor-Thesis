        <p>I would not be surprised to learn that Charles Murray, co-author of "The Bell Curve," likes to eat at Denny's, when he's not sipping Champagne at 30,000 feet. Although the menu might not be up to the standard of food served at those private dinner parties where he expounds on the correlation of race, economic status and criminal behavior, his ideas would be equally welcome at Denny's. Murray might not even be disturbed that some Denny's patrons receive more prompt and courteous service than others. He'd probably attribute it to differences in I.Q. ROBERT J. YAES, M.D. Bronx</p>
