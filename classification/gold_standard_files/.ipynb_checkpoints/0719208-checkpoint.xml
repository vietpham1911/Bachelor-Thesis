        <p>Among the ideas that have harmed mankind, one of the most durable and destructive is that the human species is divided into biological units called races and that some races are innately superior to others. At the moment this notion is being resurrected yet again, in a new and seemingly objective guise, by several prominent social scientists.</p>
        <p>Their argument goes like this. Blacks perform more poorly on I.Q. tests then whites, so they must be less intelligent. The I.Q. scores of children correlate with those of their parents, so intelligence must be at least partly governed by genes. Therefore, the I.Q. difference between blacks and whites has a genetic component that cannot be eliminated by society.</p>

        <p>Among the ideas that have harmed mankind, one of the most durable and destructive is that the human species is divided into biological units called races and that some races are innately superior to others. At the moment this notion is being resurrected yet again, in a new and seemingly objective guise, by several prominent social scientists.</p>
        <p>Their argument goes like this. Blacks perform more poorly on I.Q. tests then whites, so they must be less intelligent. The I.Q. scores of children correlate with those of their parents, so intelligence must be at least partly governed by genes. Therefore, the I.Q. difference between blacks and whites has a genetic component that cannot be eliminated by society.</p>
        <p>A highly sophisticated version of this reasoning can be found in an incendiary new book called "The Bell Curve" by Charles Murray, a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, and Richard J. Herrnstein, a professor of psychology at Harvard who died of cancer last month.</p>
        <p>The topic of racial differences in intelligence today is like the topic of sex in Victorian England, the authors submit. Among friends -- in the office, locker room and dormitory -- people say things that would be considered racist if uttered in a public forum. "As the gulf widens between public discussion and private opinion," they write, "confusion and error flourish."</p>
        <p>What the authors fail to mention is that it is social scientists such as themselves who have been responsible for much of the "confusion and error." Psychometry -- the measurement of mental faculties like intelligence -- has a long and farcical history, one driven by irrational convictions about racial superiority. Among its discoveries over the last century and a half are that Jews are not really very smart, that Mediterranean peoples are genetically inferior to Nordic ones and that the average mental age of white U.S. enlistees in World War I was 13.</p>
        <p>That such findings can now be seen to be nonsense does not, of course, mean that the conclusions like those in "The Bell Curve" should be dismissed out of hand, for genuine science sometimes sprouts from the manure of pseudoscience and quackery. But it does suggest that we should be extremely skeptical of claims that whites are on average smarter than blacks, that Japanese and Chinese are smarter than whites and that these differences are writ immutably in our genes. It also suggests that we should take a look at what the natural sciences -- biology and genetics, as against the more dubious field of psychometry -- have to say about racial differences.</p>
        <p>And here is what we learn when we do. First, the human species most likely arose only a hundred thousand years or so ago -- the day before yesterday in evolutionary time. That means that any differences among the races must have emerged since then. Superficial adaptations like skin color can evolve very quickly, in a matter of several thousand years. Changes in brain structure and capacity take far longer -- on the order of hundreds of thousands of years. Moreover, there is no evidence for such changes since Homo sapiens first appeared on the fossil record. Innate differences in intelligence among the races have simply not had enough time to evolve.</p>
        <p>Second, genetic diversity among the races is minuscule. Molecular biologists can now examine genes in different geographical populations. What they have found is that the overwhelming majority of the variation observed -- more than 85 percent -- is among individuals within the same race. Only a tiny residue distinguishes Europeans from Africans from Asians. This means that Patrick Buchanan has more in common genetically with many Xhosas and Outer Mongolians than he does with, say, Prince Charles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein respond by insisting that "some ethnic groups nonetheless differ genetically for sure, otherwise they would not have differing skin colors or hair textures. . . . The question remaining is whether the intellectual differences overlap the genetic differences to any extent."</p>
        <p>But with hundreds of human genes now mapped, it has become apparent that patterns of variation in the outwardly visible traits by which we distinguish the races are independent of those in other genetically determined traits. Biologically speaking, a person's color reveals very little indeed about what's beneath his skin.</p>
        <p>So, while all men may not be created equal when it comes to cognitive abilities, it would seem that all races are. How then do we account for the sizable gap in measured I.Q. (some 15 points on average) that seems to separate American blacks and whites?</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein are adept at rebutting many of the conventional explanations for the discrepancy -- that I.Q. tests are culturally biased, that poverty and racism alone are to blame. They and many fellow researchers have gone to heroic lengths to disentangle nature from nurture, striving to show that environmental factors explain only a small part of the racial gap.</p>
        <p>But they have not gone far enough. Perhaps that is owing to their rather naive understanding of the relation between genes and the physical embodiment of I.Q., the brain. Genes encode only a sketchy blueprint of our cortical hardware. Even identical twins, who are exact genetic clones of each other, have somewhat dissimilar brains at birth -- a consequence of the different patterns of stimulation they were exposed to in the womb, which give rise to different neuronal connections.</p>
        <p>The importance of this prenatal "hard-wiring" for a child's future intellectual prospects is only beginning to be appreciated. What is amply known, though, is that African-Americans are enormously disadvantaged when it comes to the quality of prenatal care they receive; a black mother is three times as likely as a white mother to have a low birth-weight baby. This is one environmental effect (and a correctable one) that, to the social scientist, looks like a matter of genetics.</p>
        <p>Of all the interracial comparisons of intelligence that have been made over the years, only one effectively controlled for differences in pre- and postnatal care. That was a 1961 study of the out-of-wedlock offspring of black and of white U.S. soldiers and German mothers during the Allied occupation. The very small I.Q. difference observed actually favored the black children.</p>
        <p>Put this together with adoption studies showing that an early move from a deprived home to an advantaged one can boost a child's I.Q. by 20 points, and the conviction expressed in "The Bell Curve" that public policy is impotent to redress I.Q. inequalities begins to betray a lack of imagination, if not will.</p>
        <p>Are racial differences in intelligence natural, innate and unchangeable, as some social scientists like to believe? Or can such differences be made to shrink and ultimately disappear with a better understanding of how the early environment determines the formation of our cognitive apparatus, as the conclusions of natural scientists seem to indicate? I am putting my money on the natural scientists. After all, at least one occupational study has shown that they have the higher I.Q.'s.  Jim Holt writes frequently about science and philosophy.</p>
