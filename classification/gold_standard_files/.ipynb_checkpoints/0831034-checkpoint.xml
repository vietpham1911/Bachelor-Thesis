        <p>ROBERT J. STERNBERG, 46, who is IBM Professor of Psychology and Education Psychology at Yale University, got his undergraduate degree at Yale, his Ph.D. at Stanford, then returned to Yale, where he has been ever since.</p>
        <p>In 1988 he published "The Triarch ic Mind," which discusses three kinds of intelligence: analytical, practical and creative. (His latest book, "Successful Intelligence," is due out this year.)</p>
        <p>Recently, he has challenged the conclusions in "The Bell Curve," Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's 1994 book about race and intelligence. Nor is he an admirer of standard methods of intelligence testing -- the Scholastic Aptitude Test developed by the Educational Testing Service, for example.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sternberg discussed his views in a recent interview in his office at Yale. Following are excerpts from that conversation.</p>
        <p>Q. What is intelligence?</p>
        <p>A. I call it mental self-management, the manner in which we order and make sense of the events around us or within us.</p>
        <p>Q. How did you get interested in this field?</p>
        <p>A. I had a negative experience as an undergraduate; I wanted to major in psychology, but I got a C in the intro course. I wasn't good at memorizing, and  that's what the course required. So I switched to math. And fortunately, I did even worse. So I switched back to psychology, and, in the upper level courses and in my whole career since, I've never had to memorize anything.</p>
        <p>It got me thinking: the system means that you miss a lot of good kids, conversely we get people who are not necessarily the right ones.</p>
        <p>Q. What is the triarchic theory?</p>
        <p>A. According to the theory, there are three principal aspects of intelligence: analytical -- the ability to analyze, judge, evaluate, compare and contrast; creative -- the ability to create, design, invent, originate, imagine, and practical -- the ability to use, apply, implement, put into practice. Although each can be looked at individually, they are best understood in interaction, since most tasks require a combination of skills.</p>
        <p>Q. Does your theory complement or contradict Howard Gardner's theory of seven intelligences?</p>
        <p>A. His theory specifies domains of talent: linguistic, logical/mathematical,  spatial, musical, bodily/kinesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal. It suggests fields of human endeavor. In contrast, the triarchic theory specifies uses of human knowledge for analytical, creative or practical purposes. The two theories are compatible, and in fact, we collaborated to create a program called Practical Intelligence for Schools.</p>
        <p>Q. What did you learn?</p>
        <p>A. That analytical, creative and practical intelligences can all be developed. People who are successful are those who figure out their strengths and then find ways of capitalizing on them. In the areas they are not good at, they learn enough to get by. The critical thing is to figure out what you have to offer and then make the most of it. But that's not how schools teach at all.</p>
        <p>Q. You are said to advocate "intelligent use of intelligence tests." What do  you mean by that?</p>
        <p>A. We need to expand the kinds of abilities we measure. The kind of test I use measures analytical ability but also creative and practical abilities.</p>
        <p>We have both multiple choice and essay and we find that people who do well on one often are not the same people who do well on the other. We also have verbal, quantitative and figural -- geometric with no words or numbers -- to measure each of the kinds of intelligence.</p>
        <p>Q. What did your tests reveal?</p>
        <p>A. People who are high creative and high practical were a much more diverse group. The high analytical were mostly white and high income or middle class. The former group had not been seen by their schools as particularly smart. The system is set up to benefit one kind of person, but when you get out in the world it's the creative and practical skills that matter a whole lot more.</p>
        <p>Q. Have you put this finding into practice in your research work?</p>
        <p>A. We ran a summer program at Yale and recruited high school students nominated by their schools in each of the three areas of intelligence, as well as "high balanced" and "low balanced," meaning they were high or low in all three areas. They all took an advanced placement course in psychology at Yale. But there were different classes based on the different kinds of intelligence. What we found, not surprisingly, is that if you're put in a course that matches  your ability, you do better. The only group that preferred the memory course was the "low balanced" group.</p>
        <p>Q. For a country that has a history of valuing practical skills, how did we get to this point of focusing on and rewarding just one kind of intelligence, which is not very practical?</p>
        <p>A. The system perpetuates itself. For example, people who work at E.T.S. are  high-S.A.T. types. People who do well in the system stay, and those who don't do well leave or are kicked out.</p>
        <p>Q. You worked at E.T.S. in the summer of 1970. How have tests changed since then?</p>
        <p>A. The testing industry is a dinosaur. The first Wechsler adult intelligence  scale test came out in 1939, before the Univac computer. In the computer industry if you don't innovate quickly you are dead. But if you don't have competition you don't have to innovate, and that's what's happened with the testing industry.</p>
        <p>Q. Another of your areas of research is gifted individuals. What is the problem there?</p>
        <p>A. Gifted education is always the first thing to be cut, because people say these kids can get by without special programs. Why we blow off our gifted kids  I don't understand.</p>
        <p>The biggest problem we have as a society is that today we have to be super-competitive. In global educational competition we don't do well. Our economy is a mess, our political system's a mess. If we don't get with the program we are not going to be competitive.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you see a connection between your work and the recently popular notion  of "emotional I.Q."?</p>
        <p>A. The regulation of emotions is part of translating intelligence into success. Practical and creative intelligence are very important in both interpersonal and international relations.</p>
        <p>Q. You're a prolific author. Do you attribute that mainly to analytical intelligence, or do the creative and practical play a significant role?</p>
        <p>A. It's an interplay. First you need to have ideas -- that's the creative part. Then you have to know which are good ideas -- that's analytical. The practical is knowing how to reach a given audience and to write something people will want to read.</p>
        <p>Q. About Herrnstein and Murray's "Bell Curve," how would you summarize your critique of their book?</p>
        <p>A. There is nothing new in their book. Their book is intellectually dishonest. One thing they do is equate correlation with causation, even though they say they don't do that.</p>
        <p>One example of that is when they point out that African Americans consistently score 15 points lower on S.A.T.'s than whites, and conclude from that that race is a causal variable. They discuss in detail only one of seven studies on the genetic versus environmental origins of the differences. The other six do not support a genetic interpretation, and the one they do discuss is equivocal.</p>
        <p>Their own data do not show that the difference in I.Q. scores is genetic: when they controlled for I.Q. differences, they found telling environmental differences in which blacks were much more likely to be in poverty, to have low  birth-weight babies.</p>
        <p>Q. Your books don't get the kind of media play as "The Bell Curve." Though often negative, the publicity itself gave their theory more credibility. How do you respond to that?</p>
        <p>A. There is pressure to be outrageous. My work is not outrageous enough.</p>
        <p>Q. So how do you get the word out?</p>
        <p>A. Well, I wrote an introductory psychology textbook that came out last January, called "In Search of the Human Mind." It sold over 40,000 copies in its first edition, which I'm told is very good for a book of that type.</p>
        <p>And of course I hope this new book, "Successful Intelligence," will get more  publicity. It's about what works in real life, not about what you write on tests.</p>
