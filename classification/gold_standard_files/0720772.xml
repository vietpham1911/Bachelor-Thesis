        <p>PSSST. Listen up. Forget the elections. What I am about to tell you could mean a whole lot of bucks. Like maybe 40 million. You interested? O.K., here goes. Twenty-four. That's right, the number 24. Statistically speaking it has been hot, real hot.</p>
        <p>How hot? Hot enough to have come up as one of the six winning numbers in five out of the last six drawings for the New York Lotto jackpot. There has, however, been no winning ticket in any of these lotteries. The prize money has been rolled over six times, growing to proportions that are definitely worth your time. They are worth Bill Gates's time. What I am telling you is the emmis, the McCoy, the real skinny, and I hope you appreciate that you don't get this kind of information anywhere else. Still, if you don't believe me, you could look it up.</p>

        <p>PSSST. Listen up. Forget the elections. What I am about to tell you could mean a whole lot of bucks. Like maybe 40 million. You interested? O.K., here goes. Twenty-four. That's right, the number 24. Statistically speaking it has been hot, real hot.</p>
        <p>How hot? Hot enough to have come up as one of the six winning numbers in five out of the last six drawings for the New York Lotto jackpot. There has, however, been no winning ticket in any of these lotteries. The prize money has been rolled over six times, growing to proportions that are definitely worth your time. They are worth Bill Gates's time. What I am telling you is the emmis, the McCoy, the real skinny, and I hope you appreciate that you don't get this kind of information anywhere else. Still, if you don't believe me, you could look it up.</p>
        <p>The number 24 first came up a winner on Oct. 5. It showed up again on Oct. 8 and once more on Oct. 12. Three in a row. Amazing. The next drawing, Oct. 15, it tapped out, but on Oct. 19, last Wednesday, it was back in the winners' circle of great numbers and on Saturday, there it was again.</p>
        <p>HOW unusual is this? Well, I'll tell you, it is weird and strange enough to qualify for Harold Bloom's Western canon, or at least "Unsolved Mysteries." It strains credulity. It defies the anticipated norm. In the same six weeks that number 24 was hanging out all over the place like the fashion models on the runways in Milan, 21 other possible Lotto picks, from 1 to 54, were never drawn at all. Twenty-five other numbers came up once in the six draws and three numbers came up twice. Some others came up as supplemental seventh numbers. None came up three times. None came up four times. But 24 came up five times. Nobody can remember anything like it.</p>
        <p>So what does it mean? How do I know? I'm a tout, not a philosopher.</p>
        <p>Still some people will tell you it's all just random chance, that in every drawing each number has exactly the same prospects and that what has happened is like heads coming up in a coin toss several times in a row. Unusual, but not significant. Then there are the guys who will tell you that it's their dead grandmother, the one with 24 teeth, trying to help them from the other side. It probably doesn't cost you any more to believe either way but, personally speaking, I think the romantic school has more fun with the data than the random chancers.</p>
        <p>Remarkable as 24's showing has been, the big question is what's going to happen at 11:21 tonight when the Lotto machine starts spitting out the numbered hard rubber balls in a television studio in Schenectady, where the lottery has its headquarters.</p>
        <p>This time the $40 million at stake is the fourth-largest jackpot in Lotto's 16-year history, running behind the record payoffs of $90 million, $45 million and $41 million. Will 24 continue its remarkable showing, or will its magic have vanished, eroded by the laws of probability and high numbers?</p>
        <p>BILL KNOWLTON, the public relations officer for the lottery and a random chancer, said that up there in his offices no one was much aware of the run of 24's.  "It doesn't mean a thing," he said, explaining how the numbers are printed on hard rubber balls checked for uniformity by the State Bureau of Weights and Measures.</p>
        <p>There are three sets of such balls.  On the night of the drawing one is arbitrarily picked to be swirled and selected by one of two mixing machines. Just before the televised drawing three test runs are held to see that everything is random.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Knowlton explained it, the only variable that matters is luck.</p>
        <p>Which leads to "The Bell Curve," the book that is the subject of current middle-brow hoopla. Its authors, Charles Murray and the late Richard Hernnstein, have tried to link chances of success to what they claim to be genetically ordained and ethnically determined I.Q.'s.</p>
        <p>What does a tout know about stuff like this? But the way I figure it, life has always been more like a crap shoot than a Stanford-Binet test, and maybe when you're looking for the formulas for success, you should search for the luck gene. Maybe the authors should have studied the 1,040 people who have already won more than a million dollars in Lotto.</p>
        <p>Bet you they'd find that, like all sorts of winners, they tend to think that they deserve their own good fortune and that those they leave behind are responsible for their own tough luck.</p>
        <p>But you're not like that. No, if 24 turns up, and you have the other five numbers, and you were moved to make your picks because of this column, you'll remember your uncle. Sure you will.</p>
        <p>ABOUT NEW YORK  Correction:  October 27, 1994, Thursday</p>
        <p>The About New York column yesterday, discussing numbers that have come up repeatedly in recent New York Lotto drawings, misstated the given name of the author of "The Western Canon" in some editions. He is Harold Bloom, not Allan.</p>
