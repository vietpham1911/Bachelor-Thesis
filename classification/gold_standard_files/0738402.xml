        <p>THE BEGINNING OF THE JOURNEY: The Marriage of Diana and Lionel Trilling By Diana Trilling. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13.95. Married in 1929, the Trillings were at the center of New York's intellectual life in an era when the city fancied itself the center of the world. Covering the years until 1950, this is an "extraordinary" memoir, Ann Hulbert said here in 1993. She said Mrs. Trilling "has miraculously discovered a morally dignified yet also ruthlessly honest style of self-exposure."  A FROLIC OF HIS OWN</p>

        <p>By William Gaddis. Scribner/Simon &amp; Schuster, $12. "Justice? -- You get justice in the next world, in this world you have the law." So begins the author's sendup of a legal system in which suit piles on countersuit, deposition on decree. The novel won the 1994 National Book Award for fiction and was chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of the year. Our reviewer, Robert Towers, said here last year that "the novel's mockery of the legal profession, its minions and its dupes, is extended to include a wide spectrum of contemporary American culture -- presented here, with corrosive Swiftian glee, as an unholy mess compounded of greed, ignorance, illiteracy, corruption and childish folly."  HOW WE DIE: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter By Sherwin B. Nuland. Vintage, $13. The author, a surgeon and teacher, tells in plain language what actually happens to the body when a human being dies. This book, winner of the 1994 National Book Award for nonfiction, devotes chapters to each of the primary killers, including heart failure, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Our reviewer, William F. Buckley Jr., last year called Dr. Nuland "a remarkable portraitist" who "quietly and informatively instructs and advises us." Vintage has also reissued Dr. Nuland's DOCTORS: The Biography of Medicine ($15), an account of healing from Hippocrates to organ transplants. Regina Morantz-Sanchez, writing here in 1988, said that rarely has "the general reader been offered such a captivating narrative of biomedical matters."  BRAZIL By John Updike. Fawcett Crest, $6.99. Unlikely lovers -- Tristao, a poor, black teen-ager from the slums of Rio de Janeiro, and Isabel, a rich, pampered, white girl -- flee to the wilds of western Brazil in the author's 16th novel. "It is hard to resist the depth of his mind and the seduction of his prose," our reviewer, Barbara Kingsolver, said here last year.  IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA: The Psychology of a Saint By W. W. Meissner. Yale University, $18. The soldier who founded the Jesuit order is portrayed by a biographer who is a Jesuit priest and a psychoanalytically trained psychiatrist. This work is "a touching, poignant and straightforward biography, written with clarity and an erudition that rarely deteriorates into the pedantic," Robert Coles said here in 1992.  SAVING ST. GERM By Carol Muske Dukes. Penguin, $10.95. This novel looks inside the head of a biochemist lost in her work, who mentally builds the chemical structure of nicotine when she craves a cigarette, but is not cut out for the demands of academic and family life. In 1993, our reviewer, Tom De Haven, called this "a truly original work of fiction," which explores "a subculture that's baffling, often intimidating, to most of us."  LOSING GROUND: American Social Policy, 1950-1980 By Charles Murray. Basic Books, $16. As welfare reform moves to the front burner, the author -- who won some fame, or infamy, as co-author of "The Bell Curve" -- has added a new introduction to the 10th-anniversary edition of this book. It holds that many of the Great Society programs actually made the poor worse off. "The argument is not new, but it is well made," Lawrence M. Mead said here in 1984.  THE GREEN KNIGHT By Iris Murdoch. Penguin, $12.95. The author evokes the story of Cain and Abel, and medieval romance, in the confrontation of two brothers in modern-day London. She "interweaves allusions to a rich mine of sources: Freud, Sartre, Simone Weil and Shakespeare," Linda Simon said here last year.  WITNESS AGAINST THE BEAST: William Blake and the Moral Law By E. P. Thompson. New Press, $17. In a study published just after his death in 1993, this eminent British historian reinterpreted Blake's poetry and found evidence of the religious outlook that shaped it. "The union of knowledge with imagination and conviction is the mark of this book," Aileen Ward said here last year. "It is a splendid conclusion to a life of great scholarship." In celebration of that life, The New Press has published Thompson's Making History: Writings on History and Culture ($17). It includes essays on such figures as William Morris and Mary Wollstonecraft.  PRONTO By Elmore Leonard. Dell, $5.99. For his 31st novel, the author has chosen a setting on the Italian Riviera, where a South Miami Beach bookie tries to escape his vengeful Mafia boss. The reader's payoff, our reviewer, Teresa Carpenter, said in 1993, "is the glee with which Mr. Leonard sends up the mob."  COMPLETE POEMS By Marianne Moore. Penguin, $12.95. Late in her life, Moore was anointed a cultural celebrity who posed for Life magazine at the zoo and won fame for her interest in baseball. This image, Hilton Kramer said here in 1981, "was often grotesquely at odds with the very stringent and unyielding vision of her best writing." This collection, he wrote, is "an important book, and one that every reader will want to have."  MICHAEL MOLYNEUX</p>
