0720425,"""The Bell Curve,"" a flame-throwing treatise on race, class and intelligence by the late Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray advances a grisly thesis: I.Q., largely inherited and intractable, dictates an individual's success -- an economic death knell for much of America's black population. The story has America increasingly divided by race and sliding inexorably into castes based on I.Q."
0720425,"The idea that you can explain the distribution of the ""goodies"" of life in this country by invoking arguments of race and genes is intellectually dishonest (""Daring Research or 'Social Science Pornography'?"" by Jason DeParle, Oct. 9). The public policy implications of ""The Bell Curve"" are merely Republican prescriptions for laissez-faire policies, with Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein cloaking their arguments in academic garb to gain respectability. They exalt the virtues of the marketplace and see government policies as assaults on the meritocracy. They ask us to ignore or forget that this meritocracy systematically excluded women, people of color, the disabled, etc. from the competitive process. Their argument is not new. Neither is abuse of so-called scientific research in the service of mean-spirited political objectives. THOMPSON F. WILLIAMS JR. Watertown, Mass."
0831034,"Richard J. Herrnstein, a Harvard University psychologist whose theory that intelligence was largely inherited made him a focus for debate, died at his home in Belmont, Mass., on Tuesday. He was 64."

""A few months spent by preschoolers in the first summer program seemed to be producing incredible I.Q. gains -- as much as 10 points."" The gain was so impressive that in 1966 Congress expanded the program, but by then, the authors of ""The Bell Curve"" say, ""experts were noticing the dreaded 'fade-out,' the gradual convergence in test scores of the children who participated in the program with comparable children who had not. To shorten a long story, every serious attempt to assess the impact of Head Start on intelligence has found fade-out."" Cognitive benefits ""picked up in the first grade of school are usually gone by the third grade. By sixth grade, they have vanished entirely."""

0720238,"As a psychometrician, I welcome many aspects of Jim Holt's critique of ""The Bell Curve"" (Op-Ed, Oct. 19). But Mr. Holt uses a strategy long known to bigots who denigrate an outgroup. He clumps together all social science research and then assigns to the entire class characteristics of the most despicable members. While this may be seen as cleverness by some, it is the same brand of cleverness that makes ""The Bell Curve"" so loathsome."
0720238,"No such calls to action are urged by Mr. Rushton, the author of ""Race, Evolution, and Behavior: A Life History Perspective,"" or by Mr. Herrnstein and Mr. Murray. Nowhere do they advocate the measures championed by the eugenicists of the 1920's and 1930's, whose ideas were appropriated and perverted by the Nazis as the rationale for the Holocaust. Indeed, the authors of ""The Bell Curve"" say that the granting to any government or social institution of the power to decide who may breed and who may not is fraught with such obvious dangers as to be unacceptable."
0720238,"Others are more forthright. Michael Willis was the marketing director at the Free Press in 1994, when the company published ''The Bell Curve'' by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray.''We thought it was very much the case that both professionals and the general public bought it to have it and didn't read it,'' he says. ''We got the sense even from reviews that people basically read the first chapter and the last.''"

0720238,"""What Do I.Q. Tests Measure? Not Intelligence"" by Richard A. Gardner (letter, Nov. 12) is such a collection of half-truths, distortions and inaccuracies that it takes a place toward the bottom among the heated attacks made against the book ""The Bell Curve,"" by Richard J.

0720238,"I would not be surprised to learn that Charles Murray, co-author of ""The Bell Curve,"" likes to eat at Denny's, when he's not sipping Champagne at 30,000 feet. Although the menu might not be up to the standard of food served at those private dinner parties where he expounds on the correlation of race, economic status and criminal behavior, his ideas would be equally welcome at Denny's. Murray might not even be disturbed that some Denny's patrons receive more prompt and courteous service than others. He'd probably attribute it to differences in I.Q. ROBERT J. YAES, M.D. Bronx"
0797456,"THE BELL CURVE, by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray. (Free Press, $30.) Ways in which differences in intelligence affect American life."
0797456,"The book starts with a long, somewhat discursive history of the field that pits H. H. Goddard, Charles Spearman -- of the g (for general intelligence) factor -- and other supporters of a monolithic, gene-bound intelligence against psychologists, from Raymond Cattell to Howard Gardner, who see intelligence as a mix of multiple factors. It's a story all too familiar to veterans of Psych 101. Firmly in the second camp, Mr. Perkins sees intelligence as consisting of three factors: neural intelligence (the genetic, g-producing factor), experiential intelligence (the expert's control over studied and practiced fields) and reflective intelligence. In the main part of the book he asks whether reflective intelligence -- never clearly defined, but apparently the capacity to use one's brain consciously and systematically, to make the most of one's g -- can be increased, and if so, how. He believes that training in reflective intelligence would, among other benefits, reduce the frequency with which supposedly intelligent people choose unintelligent solutions to their problems."
0732032,"On one intelligence-teaching project, in Venezuela, Mr. Perkins had as a colleague none other than Richard Herrnstein, the co-author of ""The Bell Curve,"" so the two reached diametrically opposite answers to that question on the basis of identical data. Stranger still, Mr. Perkins seems unaware of the many studies showing that subjects perform better when placed in any special program and that teachers who expect their students to be more intelligent consistently find them so, even when students have been randomly selected. How much would be left of his claims if such factors were allowed for is anyone's guess."
0732032,"Statistics are so important to the subjects under discussion that Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein offer readers a short course on the interpretation of standard deviations, regression analysis and kindred matters. Their title, ""The Bell Curve,"" refers to the shape of normal distribution graphs -- bulging in the middle and thinning out at the edges -- that are used to represent large numbers of individuals sorted according to any shared characteristic -- weight, exposure to asbestos, taste in clothes or I.Q."

0997674,"Some researchers who study intelligence say IQ scores around world have been increasing so fast that high proportion of people regarded as normal at turn of century would be considered way below average by today's tests; Dr Ulrich Neisser, professor at Cornell University and editor of The Rising Curve: Long-Term Gains in IQ and Related Measures, sees book as a rebuttal to The Bell Curve, 1994 book by Charles Murray and Richard J Herrnstein that linked IQ and income; worldwide pattern of rising scores in industrialized nations was discovered by James R Flynn, professor emeritus at University of Otago in New Zealand; he began looking into subject in 1980's in effort to rebut Dr Arthur Jensen, professor from University of California at Berkeley who argued that even if environments of blacks and whites were equalized, 15-point gap in IQ scores between races would only be partly eliminated; drawings (L)"

0997674,"The largest gains were found on  Raven's Progressive Matrices,  which were first published in 1938 by John C. Raven and developed to measure abstract reasoning ability. By relying on shapes rather than words, the widely used tests are supposed to be impervious to the influence of culture and education."
0721084,"This would hardly satisfy critics of affirmative action -- notably Charles Murray, co-author of ''The Bell Curve'' -- who argue that asking poorly prepared minorities to compete in the very best colleges reinforces racial stereotypes. Mr. Murray argues that affirmative action actually harms the intended beneficiaries by increasing their chance of failure. But here again, what seems obvious is apparently not true. While the nonwhites in Mr. Kane's sample did underperform their white counterparts at elite colleges even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, the performance gap was smaller than at unselective schools. Black or white, students from similar backgrounds who attended elite schools were more likely to finish school and had higher earnings if they did finish."

0721084,"Dr. Herrnstein first set off debate on I.Q., race and class in 1971 when he published an article in The Atlantic Monthly contending that intelligence is largely inherited, so no matter what efforts were made, egalitaranism would not work."
0721084,"But bleak as ""The Bell Curve"" 's vision may be, it is not entirely new. Herrnstein has been saying similar things for two decades. And the fear that a meritocratic society will prove a dystopian one is at least a half-century old. In 1958, the British sociologist Michael Young, a member of the Labor Party, sketched a similar scenario in his novel ""The Rise of the Meritocracy."" He saw the trend leading to an armed rebellion by the year 2034."

Standardized tests of intelligence have been widely condemned for cultural bias, and their use as sorting devices has been discouraged by the courts as well as by liberal opinion. But whatever the tests measure, Mr. Herrnstein, who died last month, and Mr. Murray correctly remind us that the scores predict success in school for ethnic minorities as well as for whites."

0721084,"The phenomenon of the unread best seller comes to mind because of the recent publication of ''Ravelstein,'' Saul Bellow's novel about the life and death of his friend Allan Bloom. In life, Bloom was a humanities professor well known only in the academy who gained international fame in 1987 after the surprising success of his dense treatise ''The Closing of the American Mind.'' To this day, many consider it one of the prime examples of an emperor's new book."

At a moment of considerable East-West tension, when the phrase ''clash of civilizations'' has rarely had greater currency, Mr. Murray has issued what he says is a mathematically precise global assessment of human achievement, a ''résumé'' of the species in which Europeans like Shakespeare, Beethoven and Einstein predominate and in which Christianity stands out as a crucial spur to excellence.

0718184,"While lots of critics have worried about rising inequality, ""The Bell Curve"" veers away from more familiar discussions by its emphasis on genes. While others use words like ""education"" or ""test scores"" to describe the sorting mechanism at work, Herrnstein and Murray use the word ""intelligence"" and stress its genetic roots. Citing studies that estimate that from 40 to 80 percent of an individual's intelligence stems from genes, the authors take a midpoint of 60 percent. (The studies refer to how much an average individual's I.Q. is affected by genes, not to the cause of interracial differences in intelligence.)"

No more ''transfers of payment'' like Social Security, Medicare and food stamps. No more regulation of work places. Just a government that restrains people from injuring one another, enforces contracts and upholds what Mr. Murray defines in a strictly limited sense as the public good. A very minority position indeed, although hardly a surprise from the author of ''Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950-1980'' and (with Richard J.

These students, who were tested and measured at the outset of the study in 1979, have been tracked ever since. Based on the psychometric indicators and the personal histories of these young people, the authors found various suggestive correlations and concluded that the biggest influence on the lives of the people in their sample was the ""g"" factor -- psychometricians' jargon for core intelligence."
0718184,"The I.Q. worshipers of today remain essentially unchanged from Goddard's time. Despite the impression that there is something new in ""The Bell Curve,"" its authors, Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein, have merely reasserted the long-unproven claim that I.Q. is mainly inherited. The language is calmer, the statistical gimmicks slicker, but the truth remains the same: There exist no plausible data to make the case. Belief to the contrary rests mainly on brutal preconceptions about poverty, but also on a basic confusion between pseudo-science and the real thing. BRENT STAPLES"
0718184,"Definitions of intelligence have always been controversial, as have been tests devised to measure it quantitatively. In 1904, the British psychometrician Charles Spearman conceived of a quality he called ""g,"" or ""general factor"" of intelligence, which has remained part of the psychometrician's lexicon ever since. Spearman's idea was based on his finding that people tend to achieve similar scores on tests that may be very different in content but that contain questions requiring cognitive skill. Such questions were said to measure ""g,"" and tests that emphasized this factor rather than calling for demonstrations of learned skills are said to be ""g-loaded"" tests."

0718184,"The debate intensified by the publication of ""The Bell Curve"" is about more than intelligence, achievement and race. It's about who and what is American, whom we choose to cherish and whom we discard. The most important campaign issue this season was immigration and how America's changing racial and ethnic composition affects the core values of our country. Proposition 187 in California was designed, among other things, to bar public schools from teaching illegal immigrants and to prevent hospitals from providing them with nonemergency medical care. Many of those who led the charge for Proposition 187 argued that the greatest danger of unchecked immigration is not to the economy, but to American culture itself."

1019856,"Also compelling is evidence about the second notable error -- that the authors' measure of intelligence is by no means immutable, as their thesis requires. Prof. Derek Neal of the University of Chicago and Prof. William Johnson of the University of Virginia have shown that scores on the measurement used by Mr. Herrnstein and Mr. Murray, the Armed Forces Qualification Test, depend on how much schooling individuals have completed. Put simply, the more students study in school, the better they do on the test. So what the authors call immutable intelligence turns out to be what others call skills -- indeed, teachable skills."

An article quoted scholars speculating that the book was based on pseudoscience, while the editorial page attacked the book's ""high ignorance quotient."""

0716812,"In ""The Bell Curve,"" Charles Murray himself admits that the right environment can raise I.Q. Can he not see then that a disadvantaged environment can eat away at a young person's ability to learn? In America, racism and class prejudice have subjected entire populations to disadvantaged environments. Rather than stigmatize them, Mr. Murray should call for sensible action."
0716812,"In the book, Dr. Herrnstein and his co-author, Charles Murray, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington, contend that I.Q. is linked to economic success, criminality and being dependent on welfare. They argue that since I.Q. is fixed by genetics, it cannot be changed meaningfully by environment or learning."
0716812,"At least until the new book arrives. In Richard Herrnstein, Murray found his equal in two vital categories -- intelligence and shock value. Superficially, their backgrounds could not be more dissimilar. Herrnstein's parents were left-wing, Jewish immigrants from Hungary who raised him in a working-class neighborhood of the Bronx."
0716812,"He accuses two of them -- Dr. Richard Lewontin, a population geneticist at Harvard, and the late Dr. Stephen J. Gould, a historian of science -- of ''25 years of pointless attacks'' on Dr. Wilson and on Dr. Richard Dawkins, author of ''The Selfish Gene,'' for allegedly saying certain aspects of behavior are genetically determined."
0716812,"Others will question whether I.Q. really is, as Herrnstein and Murray assert, the all-encompassing measure of mental aptitude. One leading skeptic is Robert Sternberg, a Yale psychologist, who has pioneered the study of what he calls practical intelligence. He cites experiments among housewives who are failures at pad-and-pencil math but competent comparison shoppers when they hit the supermarket aisle. ""That's not to say I.Q. counts zero,"" he says. ""It's to say that there are other kinds of intelligence that are equally or maybe more important."""
0716812,Daring Research or 'Social Science Pornography'?: Charles Murray
0716812,"Though he was an acclaimed psychologist who held B. F. Skinner's former chair at Harvard, Herrnstein's notoriety stems from his nonacademic work. In 1971, he published an article in The Atlantic Monthly about the heritability of intelligence, famously predicting a future in which the ""the tendency to be unemployed may run in the genes of a family about as certainly as bad teeth do now."" Though Herrnstein dealt only peripherally with race, militant students branded him a racist, interrupted his lectures and, he said, threatened him with physical violence."
0716812,"Outrageousness, after all, has been good to Charles Murray. He was an unemployed Ph.D. stuck in a midlife crisis a decade ago when he produced ""Losing Ground,"" the book that eroded the assumptions guiding American social policy. With 236 pages of charts and tables, it lent an aura of scientific support to an old suspicion -- that welfare and other social programs cause more problems than they solve. Taking the thought a step further, Murray spoke the unspeakable: why not just abolish them all?"
0716812,"The reason for the unease is no mystery: theories of genetic differences have a long and ugly history, especially when it comes to race. Herrnstein and Murray acknowledge as much, and worry that their book, ""wrongly construed, might do harm."" They hedge their bet slightly, saying the evidence ""suggests, without quite proving, genetic roots"" for part of the black-white difference. They even call the debate over genes a distraction from more important issues. But once again Murray may be saying with scientific references and assurances of his own good will what others murmur darkly in barrooms and taxis. And his disclaimers are unlikely to mute critics."
0716812,"The genetic argument was repeated in a section of ''The Bell Curve'' (The Free Press, 1994 ) by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray. Other academics have offered a range of evidence to debunk their position, which caused an uproar. But Stephanie Robinson of the Education Trust, a nonprofit group in Washington that works with communities trying to raise test scores, says the book merely put into print notions hinted at elsewhere, from portrayals of blacks in film to banks' refusal to offer mortgages to those living in black neighborhoods."
0716812,"One group of skeptics will question whether intelligence is as newly influential, or as dominant, a force in American life as Herrnstein and Murray believe. They are almost certainly right that the intelligent person can rise more easily today than a century ago. But brains have always helped, even before such gifts could be measured at the end of a No. 2 pencil. Witness Huck Finn."

0734680,"One of those others is William Shockley, a memorable nut who argued a quarter-century ago in favor of sterilizing those with low I.Q.'s.  Shockley receives only one guarded paragraph in the 845 pages of ""The Bell Curve."" Yet his old pronouncements are everywhere."
0719208,"To some degree, their resistance was based on moral qualms. From the late 19th-century social Darwinists, who invoked evolution to justify nationalism, war and poverty, to more recent thinkers like Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray, whose 1994 book ''The Bell Curve'' linked intelligence, race and genes, biological accounts of human affairs have frequently been accused of being simplistic and biased."
0719208,"As a psychometrician, I welcome many aspects of Jim Holt's critique of ""The Bell Curve"" (Op-Ed, Oct. 19). But Mr. Holt uses a strategy long known to bigots who denigrate an outgroup. He clumps together all social science research and then assigns to the entire class characteristics of the most despicable members. While this may be seen as cleverness by some, it is the same brand of cleverness that makes ""The Bell Curve"" so loathsome."
0719208,"Supposedly ""The Bell Curve"" is controversy incarnate. By offering an alarmist interpretation of the fact that blacks as a group score 15 points lower than whites in I.Q. tests, the book's authors are, in their words, bravely tackling ""a taboo issue"" or, as their critics have it, recklessly fanning the flames of racial division in a nation already at the brink."

Educational optimists would stop raising expectations that they cannot, at least yet, hope to fulfill. A century from now we may finally be able to assess intelligence without fuzzy thinking.

They are wrong because they blind us to more compelling interpretations and because they ignore the huge gaps in understanding the precise nature of intelligence. What is right about the book was already well known: skills have taken on increasing importance in the economy and they are difficult to acquire. What is new about the book -- the fixation on genes as destiny -- is surely unproved and almost surely wrong: programs here and abroad produce measurable, if unspectacular, results. These sobering lessons were clear before ""The Bell Curve"" was published. They remain so afterward."
0902956,"The repudiation of racial groupings simply ignores well-established, interlocking forms of physiological, anatomical and genetic evidence for these groupings. The demand for an evolutionary rationale overlooks the fact that J. Philippe Rushton offers a strong causal, evolutionary hypothesis. Whether ultimately right or wrong, his hypothesis is a starting point for further research. Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray offer very little in the way of a causal theory; they're just organizing empirical information. But to repudiate all empirical information unless it already fits within a fully established causal theory -- as Mr. Pflaum demands -- is wholly arbitrary. Such ad hoc methodological restrictions are merely strategies of obfuscation and intellectual obstruction disguising themselves as scientific rigor. This kind of thing is, of course, nothing new. What is new, and worthy of some quiet celebration, is that objective scientific studies like those reviewed in the Book Review could get a fair, thoughtful and reasonable hearing in a major public forum. JOSEPH CARROLL  St. Louis"
0720111,"The entire book suffers from this lack of clarity. In a chapter on voyages to the moon in literature, Mr. Disch will be discussing, say, H. G. Wells, when suddenly Wells's ''evolutionary subtext'' will get him onto ''The Bell Curve,'' by Charles Murray, whose thesis, Mr. Disch writes, ''dismays for the same reason that 'The Time Machine' and 'The Origin of Species' do: it suggests that human nature is not a God-given absolute, but an un-Platonic variable, the function of our malleable genes.''  This makes sense only if you don't ask where Mr. Disch is coming from or where he's going."
0720110,"But the counterrevolution has arrived fast. Last Saturday at my local Barnes  & Noble, Newt Gingrich's formerly best-selling ""To Renew America"" was stacked on the 50-percent-off table next to ""Kato Kaelin: The Whole Truth."" Dinesh D'Souza's ""The End of Racism,"" tirelessly promoted as a controversial ideological companion piece to ""The Bell Curve,"" never made the Times list. Neither have Mr. Gingrich's novel ""1945,"" Mr. D'Amato's ""Power, Pasta and Politics,"" Pat Robertson's ""The End of the Age"" or Ben Wattenberg's ""Values Matter Most."""
0720110,"Put nature and nurture on the scales of science's analytical balance and it becomes a seesaw that never comes to rest. In the latest gyration, Mr. Murray, Mr. Herrnstein and other scholars have marshaled statistical evidence supporting the notion that some races are naturally more intelligent than others. But statistics, by their very nature, are tricky to interpret and tend to be most persuasive when they tell us what we already think we know."

0725182,"Now, in middle age, Mr. Murray gets his kicks by thinking up ways to drape the cloak of respectability over the obscene and long-discredited views of the world's most rabid racists. And so ""The Bell Curve,"" written with Richard Herrnstein, who died last month, promotes the view that blacks are inherently inferior to whites."
0725182,"But Dr. Sternberg, the author of ''Successful Intelligence: How Creative and Practical Intelligence Determine Success in Life'' and ''Love Is a Story: A New Theory of Relationships,'' also has his critics."

0726452,"Perhaps Dr. Sternberg's harshest critic is Dr. Linda Gottfredson, a sociologist at the University of Delaware and the author of a critique of Dr. Sternberg's work on practical intelligence, to appear later this year in the journal Intelligence. ''The bottom line for me is that he hasn't provided any good evidence to support his claim that there is a separate practical intelligence,'' Dr. Gottfredson said."
0763851,"In 1988 he published ""The Triarch ic Mind,"" which discusses three kinds of intelligence: analytical, practical and creative. (His latest book, ""Successful Intelligence,"" is due out this year.)"
0763851,"Look again at that unpalatable first premise. Standardized tests of intelligence have been widely condemned for cultural bias, and their use as sorting devices has been discouraged by the courts as well as by liberal opinion. But whatever the tests measure, Mr. Herrnstein, who died last month, and Mr. Murray correctly remind us that the scores predict success in school for ethnic minorities as well as for whites."
0763851,"I would not be surprised to learn that Charles Murray, co-author of ""The Bell Curve,"" likes to eat at Denny's, when he's not sipping Champagne at 30,000 feet. Although the menu might not be up to the standard of food served at those private dinner parties where he expounds on the correlation of race, economic status and criminal behavior, his ideas would be equally welcome at Denny's. Murray might not even be disturbed that some Denny's patrons receive more prompt and courteous service than others. He'd probably attribute it to differences in I.Q. ROBERT J. YAES, M.D. Bronx"
0763851,"The book starts with a long, somewhat discursive history of the field that pits H. H. Goddard, Charles Spearman -- of the g (for general intelligence) factor -- and other supporters of a monolithic, gene-bound intelligence against psychologists, from Raymond Cattell to Howard Gardner, who see intelligence as a mix of multiple factors. It's a story all too familiar to veterans of Psych 101. Firmly in the second camp, Mr. Perkins sees intelligence as consisting of three factors: neural intelligence (the genetic, g-producing factor), experiential intelligence (the expert's control over studied and practiced fields) and reflective intelligence. In the main part of the book he asks whether reflective intelligence -- never clearly defined, but apparently the capacity to use one's brain consciously and systematically, to make the most of one's g -- can be increased, and if so, how. He believes that training in reflective intelligence would, among other benefits, reduce the frequency with which supposedly intelligent people choose unintelligent solutions to their problems."

0763851,"IN one corner, serious social scientists (alias racist reactionaries) who believe intelligence is mostly genetically determined and cannot be significantly modified. In the other corner, serious social scientists (alias wishy-washy liberals) who believe intelligence is influenced by culture and can be improved by education. Ding-ding! Time for yet another round in the Great I.Q. Slugfest that's been going on for decades, with both parties still gamely sparring, though showing signs of fatigue. The current contender, David Perkins, is a senior research associate at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. His ""Outsmarting IQ,"" the latest in a series of books written or edited by him on the teaching of thinking, sets out to show that, in the author's own words, ""intelligence can be taught."""
1424320,"But in the last few years, conservative intellectuals have developed an inflexible, hard-edged dogma when it comes to race. There was a time, from the mid-1970's through the late 1980's, when some of the most nuanced and serious thinking about race came from the right -- whether it was James Q. Wilson's work on adolescent criminal behavior, Nathan Glazer's criticism of racial quotas or Charles Murray's analysis of the welfare state. They were concerned about the plight of black Americans. And their writing had a subtlety of thought and a generosity of spirit."
1424320,"He accuses two of them -- Dr. Richard Lewontin, a population geneticist at Harvard, and the late Dr. Stephen J. Gould, a historian of science -- of ''25 years of pointless attacks'' on Dr. Wilson and on Dr. Richard Dawkins, author of ''The Selfish Gene,'' for allegedly saying certain aspects of behavior are genetically determined."
1424320,"Dr. Pinker first became known outside his specialty through his 1994 book ''The Language Instinct,'' an approachable account of how the brain is constructed to learn language. He followed up that success with ''How the Mind Works,'' in which he shared his enthusiasm for the ideas of evolutionary psychology. ''The Blank Slate'' further broadens his ambit from neuroscience to political and social theory."
0738402,"Published on Oct. 21 by HarperCollins and accompanied by a publicity release optimistically anointing it ''his most ambitious and controversial work yet,'' ''Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950'' is well timed to stir debate. At a moment of considerable East-West tension, when the phrase ''clash of civilizations'' has rarely had greater currency, Mr. Murray has issued what he says is a mathematically precise global assessment of human achievement, a ''résumé'' of the species in which Europeans like Shakespeare, Beethoven and Einstein predominate and in which Christianity stands out as a crucial spur to excellence. Equally provocative, he maintains that the rate of Western accomplishment is currently in decline."
0738402,"That would be tragic. Though ""The Bell Curve"" contains serious scholarship, it is also laced with tendentious interpretation. Once unlike-minded scholars have time to react, they will subject its findings to withering criticism. At its best, the Herrnstein-Murray story is an unconvincing reading of murky evidence. At its worst, it is perniciously and purposely incendiary. The graphs, charts, tables and data admit of less dire conclusions. But less dire would not have put Mr. Murray on the cover of news magazines, though it would have given America's disadvantaged a more accurate, hopeful glimpse of their future."
0738402,"In response to Malcolm W. Browne's review of books on race and I.Q., Will Pflaum has written a letter to The Times Book Review that was also distributed on the E-mail network of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society, a discussion group composed mainly of evolutionary scientists. Mr. Pflaum repudiates racial groupings as they appear in ""Race, Evolution, and Behavior"" and ""The Bell Curve,"" and also demands a fully worked-out theoretical rationale for racial differences before we even begin to consider the empirical evidence."
0738402,"In 1993, our reviewer, Tom De Haven, called this ""a truly original work of fiction,"" which explores ""a subculture that's baffling, often intimidating, to most of us."" LOSING GROUND: American Social Policy, 1950-1980 By Charles Murray. Basic Books, $16."
0721353,"A few days after you published Malcolm W. Browne's quite favorable review of three new books that attribute intelligence primarily to genetic factors, I came across a discussion of intelligence testing in William Broad and Nicholas Wade's 1982 book, ""Betrayers of the Truth."" Mr. Broad and Mr. Wade list ""three cardinal principles"" for the use of intelligence tests, as laid down by the tests' inventor, Alfred Binet: ""Binet's Rule 1 was: The scores do not define anything innate or permanent. Rule 2: The scale is a rough guide for identifying and helping learning-disabled children; it is not a way of measuring normal children. Rule 3: Low scores don't mean a child is innately incapable."""
0721353,"The I.Q. believers worked with messianic zeal. Like many before him, the British psychologist Sir Cyril Burt went way beyond science in defense of his beliefs. Burt alleged that intelligence was so wired into the genes, so indifferent to environment, that identical twins reared apart had virtually identical I.Q. scores. Statisticians now agree that Burt made much of it up."
0964119,"Others will question whether I.Q. really is, as Herrnstein and Murray assert, the all-encompassing measure of mental aptitude. One leading skeptic is Robert Sternberg, a Yale psychologist, who has pioneered the study of what he calls practical intelligence. He cites experiments among housewives who are failures at pad-and-pencil math but competent comparison shoppers when they hit the supermarket aisle. ""That's not to say I.Q. counts zero,"" he says. ""It's to say that there are other kinds of intelligence that are equally or maybe more important."""

0964119,"It could hardly have been otherwise. The book's authors, Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, did not release their statistical findings -- the only important original contributions in the book -- for formal review by scholars before publication. Their runaround obstructed response by other social scientists, who needed time to appraise hundreds of pages of statistical analysis.

Now, three years later, scholars have caught up, shattering the book's core claims."
0964119,"Also compelling is evidence about the second notable error -- that the authors' measure of intelligence is by no means immutable, as their thesis requires. Prof. Derek Neal of the University of Chicago and Prof. William Johnson of the University of Virginia have shown that scores on the measurement used by Mr. Herrnstein and Mr. Murray, the Armed Forces Qualification Test, depend on how much schooling individuals have completed. Put simply, the more students study in school, the better they do on the test. So what the authors call immutable intelligence turns out to be what others call skills -- indeed, teachable skills."
0964119,"Messrs. Herrnstein and Murray use statistical tools to determine whether differences in intelligence or environment better explain, for example, which individuals  commit crimes, drop out of high school or wind up poor. The authors find that, in their all-white sample, low intelligence leads to social pathology. High intelligence leads to success. Family background plays a secondary role. That suggests that compensatory education and training are almost certain to fail."
0964119,"''The Bell Curve'' inflamed readers when it was published three years ago by arguing that economic and social success in America had become largely a matter of genes, not education, environment or other factors over which society might exert control. The chilling genes-are-destiny thesis, laced with racial overtones, was greeted with furious criticism. But much of the initial criticism was ill informed and driven by ideology."

0720885,"The phenomenon of the unread best seller comes to mind because of the recent publication of ''Ravelstein,'' Saul Bellow's novel about the life and death of his friend Allan Bloom. In life, Bloom was a humanities professor well known only in the academy who gained international fame in 1987 after the surprising success of his dense treatise ''The Closing of the American Mind.'' To this day, many consider it one of the prime examples of an emperor's new book."
0734262,"Though he was an acclaimed psychologist who held B. F. Skinner's former chair at Harvard, Herrnstein's notoriety stems from his nonacademic work. In 1971, he published an article in The Atlantic Monthly about the heritability of intelligence, famously predicting a future in which the ""the tendency to be unemployed may run in the genes of a family about as certainly as bad teeth do now."" Though Herrnstein dealt only peripherally with race, militant students branded him a racist, interrupted his lectures and, he said, threatened him with physical violence."
0907950,"Mr. Crouch loves the stew of American democracy, the ferment of nationalities; what he calls the ""gumbo"" of our culture and ""our miscegenated identity as Americans."" This allows him to answer the question raised by Charles Murray in ""The Bell Curve"" of whether ""the majority of Negroes,"" in Mr. Crouch's words, ""are doomed by their genes to be less intelligent than white people."" Mr. Crouch simply asserts that ""no matter your definition of Afro-American culture, there is, quite frankly, no Afro-American race."""
0726624,"""Whether this is good depends on what one thinks of abortion,"" Charles Murray said last summer. Mr. Murray is co-author of ""The Bell Curve"" (The Free Press, 1994), which theorizes that society is stratified by I.Q., which is based in part on genetic endowment."
0726624,"Profile of and interview with controversial social scientist Charles Murray whose latest book, Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800 BC to 1950, is expected to stir more ire; Murray uses relatively obscure statistical method known as historiometry to back his assertion of Western civilization's scientific and artistic superiority; photo; graphs (M)"
0722989,"Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein produce evidence in their book ""The Bell Curve"" showing that the 15-point gap between white and black I.Q. scores remains even after controlling for all sorts of social factors. But there is one factor they do not discuss."
0720884,"Jim Holt's article on ""The Bell Curve"" (Op-Ed, Oct. 19) made a number of important biological points about race and intelligence. His perspective becomes even richer if we consider the context of our evolutionary history."
0911811,"Malcolm W. Browne's excellent review of three new books on race and intelligence shows a healthy respect for empirical reality. It is a fact of nature that people are not created equal in the eyes of I.Q. tests. Concomitantly, and most fortunately, it is a fact of human nature that we can make all people equal in the eyes of the law. Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Sam Adams were not confused on that point, and this is no time to encourage obfuscation. JOHN HARTUNG  Atlantic Beach, L.I."
0725192,"Malcolm W. Browne cites Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray's argument that they can prove that intelligence tests are not systematically biased against blacks because ""if the S.A.T. is biased against blacks, it will underpredict their college performance."" Since their examination of ""hundreds of studies"" reveals that such tests do correctly predict performance, they conclude that these tests are therefore not biased."

0725192,"Which leads to ""The Bell Curve,"" the book that is the subject of current middle-brow hoopla. Its authors, Charles Murray and the late Richard Hernnstein, have tried to link chances of success to what they claim to be genetically ordained and ethnically determined I.Q.'s."
1013441,"Outrageousness, after all, has been good to Charles Murray. He was an unemployed Ph.D. stuck in a midlife crisis a decade ago when he produced ""Losing Ground,"" the book that eroded the assumptions guiding American social policy. With 236 pages of charts and tables, it lent an aura of scientific support to an old suspicion -- that welfare and other social programs cause more problems than they solve. Taking the thought a step further, Murray spoke the unspeakable: why not just abolish them all?"
0720886,"""The Bell Curve"" and other books on the relationship of heredity and intelligence have made some constructive suggestions -- the importance of more research on social maladjustment, and the need for more creative imagination than we now observe in planning social welfare and in education."
0720886,"At least until the new book arrives. In Richard Herrnstein, Murray found his equal in two vital categories -- intelligence and shock value. Superficially, their backgrounds could not be more dissimilar. Herrnstein's parents were left-wing, Jewish immigrants from Hungary who raised him in a working-class neighborhood of the Bronx."

0725183,"The reason for the unease is no mystery: theories of genetic differences have a long and ugly history, especially when it comes to race. Herrnstein and Murray acknowledge as much, and worry that their book, ""wrongly construed, might do harm."" They hedge their bet slightly, saying the evidence ""suggests, without quite proving, genetic roots"" for part of the black-white difference. They even call the debate over genes a distraction from more important issues. But once again Murray may be saying with scientific references and assurances of his own good will what others murmur darkly in barrooms and taxis. And his disclaimers are unlikely to mute critics."
0725183,"Like Dr. Howard Gardner, the author of ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences,'' Dr. Sternberg believes that society must broaden its lens, integrating a wider array of abilities into its conception of aptitude and achievement."
0725183,"Viewers may think twice before again using the terms ""highbrow"" and ""lowbrow"" culture. These terms originated with studies and drawings, included in the show, purporting to show that whites had higher foreheads to accommodate a larger cerebral cortex, while blacks had lower brows and a smaller cortex. Anthropologists later showed that the angle of the forehead varies within all groups, and that brain size is linked to body size, not to race or intelligence. After World War I, debate on intelligence shifted from spurious analysis of physical traits to the new science of I.Q., where it remains, flaring anew this year with the publication of ""The Bell Curve,"" by Richard J.

It makes little difference whether people at the low end of the intelligence scale pass on their deficit genetically or environmentally, they say: ""If women with low scores are reproducing more rapidly than women with high scores, the distribution of scores will, other things equal, decline, no matter whether the women with the low scores came by them through nature or nurture."""

As welfare reform moves to the front burner, the author -- who won some fame, or infamy, as co-author of ""The Bell Curve"" -- has added a new introduction to the 10th-anniversary edition of this book. It holds that many of the Great Society programs actually made the poor worse off."
0725197,"All this time when the country is cozy in bed with ""The Bell Curve"" by Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein. For many, justification that blacks have lower intelligence quotients perpetuates the scapegoating. But as the black Harvard professor Cornel West asserts in his book ""Race Matters"": ""We confine discussions about race to the 'problems' black people pose for whites, rather than consider what this way of viewing black people reveals about us as a nation."""
0725197,"In the Texaco case, black employees received raises that brought them to salary equality with their white counterparts. To Mr. Henderson this might sound fair, but would it sound fair to Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, who in their book, ''The Bell Curve,'' show that income equality already exists in corporate America if the determining factor is I.Q., not race?"
0725197,"The academic fields of inquiry vary very widely, indeed, as to internal agreements on assumptions, methods and interpretations. Disputes within, let us say, astrophysics and microbiology are hardly as pronounced as those within, for instance, economics and psychology. In these last, cultural and social preferences do shape intellectual work to a very large degree. Perhaps, then, it was Malcolm W. Browne's immersion in the more rigorous natural sciences that led him to characterize the authors under review as ""recognized by colleagues as serious scholars."" Leaving Seymour W. Itzkoff out of it, it is impossible to discern in the American academy any general acceptance for the view that Richard J. Herrnstein, Charles Murray and J. Philippe Rushton merit the designation ""serious."" Large numbers of us consider their writings to be prima facie evidence for ideological blindness and, indeed, fanaticism and hatred. That is a kind of seriousness -- but not the sort, clearly, Mr. Browne was thinking of. NORMAN BIRNBAUM  Washington"

0727895,"The authors of ""The Bell Curve"" go much further, however, slipping a moral dimension into the argument. They say intelligence also predicts crime rates, welfare dependence, poor parenting and indifference to civic responsibility. And they cleverly trump their race-conscious critics by looking solely at the evidence of differences among whites."
0727895,"Malcolm W. Browne's excellent review of three new books on race and intelligence shows a healthy respect for empirical reality. It is a fact of nature that people are not created equal in the eyes of I.Q. tests. Concomitantly, and most fortunately, it is a fact of human nature that we can make all people equal in the eyes of the law. Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Sam Adams were not confused on that point, and this is no time to encourage obfuscation. JOHN HARTUNG  Atlantic Beach, L.I."
0725188,"Similarly, the Armed Forces Qualifying Test, on which Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray rely heavily, has been shown to mismeasure the abilities of many young men. Because of an error in setting norms for the test, the United States military accepted a much higher percentage of low-scoring enlistees than it intended from 1976 to 1980. Yet the on-the-job performance of those new soldiers -- who would have been rejected if the test had been scored properly -- was essentially the same as those who really ""passed.""  PAMELA ZAPPARDINO  Cambridge, Mass."
0725188,"Some will consider Malcolm W. Browne's review of Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray's ""Bell Curve,"" J. Philippe Rushton's ""Race, Evolution, and Behavior"" and Seymour W. Itzkoff's ""Decline of Intelligence in America"" politically faulty, and I am sure you will receive many letters criticizing the politics of both the reviewer and the authors. My criticism comes from a different point of view. I see little in this review to suggest that either Mr. Browne or the authors understand some basic principles of evolution."
0720887,"Some researchers who study intelligence say IQ scores around world have been increasing so fast that high proportion of people regarded as normal at turn of century would be considered way below average by today's tests; Dr Ulrich Neisser, professor at Cornell University and editor of The Rising Curve: Long-Term Gains in IQ and Related Measures, sees book as a rebuttal to The Bell Curve, 1994 book by Charles Murray and Richard J Herrnstein that linked IQ and income; worldwide pattern of rising scores in industrialized nations was discovered by James R Flynn, professor emeritus at University of Otago in New Zealand; he began looking into subject in 1980's in effort to rebut Dr Arthur Jensen, professor from University of California at Berkeley who argued that even if environments of blacks and whites were equalized, 15-point gap in IQ scores between races would only be partly eliminated; drawings (L)"
0720887,"After years of study, the best one can conclude is that teacher expectations, if they have any effect at all, are among the least important of the environmental variables that most scholars, including Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein, authors of ""The Bell Curve,"" believe contribute to adult I.Q. BYRON M. ROTH  Professor of Psychology Dowling College Sayville, L.I., Dec. 26, 1994"
0725186,"The writers of these works are recognized by colleagues as serious scholars. Mr. Herrnstein, who died from lung cancer at the age of 64 this September, just before publication of ""The Bell Curve,"" was a professor of psychology at Harvard University; Mr. Murray, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute whose views influenced the Reagan White House, is the author of ""Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950-1980""; J. Philippe Rushton, the firebrand of the quartet, is a professor of psychology at the University of Western Ontario, and Mr. Itzkoff is a professor of education at Smith College."
0725189,"But in recent years there is a surprising lack of agreement among scientists over the popular notions of what constitutes a racial group. And even in their book, ""The Bell Curve,"" which suggests that differences in intelligence between races are a matter of inheritance, Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray, duck the question. ""The rule we follow here is a simple one,"" they write, ""to classify people according to the way they classify themselves."""
0725193,"The very essence of the brain is this malleability, and that is what makes many biologists skeptical when social scientists or psychologists claim -- as Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray do in their new book, ""The Bell Curve"" -- that they have found evidence that intelligence is essentially inherent. Does mental dexterity reside among the general features of the brain, recorded in the pages of the recipe book called the genetic code? Or can it be more likely found in that vast appendix of chance occurrences called life?"

0725194,"After such a buildup, readers may be expecting some effective antidotes to the genetic pessimism of Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's ""Bell Curve."" If so, they will be disappointed. Mr. Perkins describes several educational programs that specifically teach problem solving, decision making, organization, creativity and other aspects of reflective intelligence. Unfortunately, his assessments of these, lacking significance tests, double blinds or other accepted evaluation measures, are inconclusive: ""No follow-up information is available""; ""improvements in classroom behavior resulted but not in academic performance or on standardized tests""; ""little information is available on whether . . . effects persist or are soon forgotten."" Maybe intelligence can be taught -- but can it be learned?"
0725187,"''It's conceivable that if you say anything is innate, people will say you are racist, but the climate has changed,'' he says. ''I don't actually believe that the I.Q. gap is genetic, so I didn't say anything nearly as inflammatory as Herrnstein and Murray,'' the authors of the 1994 book ''The Bell Curve,'' who argued that inborn differences in intelligence explain much of the economic inequality in American society."
0725191,"But isn't it also possible that a publisher is simply hawking a book?  The incendiary ""science"" in ""The Bell Curve"" is not new; its policy prescriptions are conservative boilerplate. Had the authors compared the I.Q. scores of men and women, that might have been a cry of ""Fire!"" in a societal tinderbox. As ""The Bell Curve"" stands, however, Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein might be more accurately charged with rehashing the work of others (and sometimes their own) for financial and political profit."

0727896,"In fact, Dr. Sternberg, a professor of psychology at Yale, a prolific researcher, a widely known expert on intelligence testing and the progenitor of his own theory of ''successful'' intelligence, in some ways owes his entire career to an early failure: hobbled by test anxiety, he scored poorly on an I.Q. test when he was 6 years old, the beginning of a lifelong obsession with developing his own measures of mental abilities."
0727896,"Seymour W. Itzkoff, whose book ""The Decline of Intelligence in America: A Strategy for National Renewal"" is the gloomiest of the group, writes: ""Our problem is simple, but oh-so-difficult to discuss, let alone accept. We are a different people than we were 50 years ago. In truth, we are not the nation that we were. Relative to the rest of the developed and developing world, we probably no longer have the intellectual capital that can profit from the available educational resources."""
