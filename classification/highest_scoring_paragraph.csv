0724174,"Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein, authors of the controversial book, ""The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life"" (the Free Press), make no secret of their pessimism about the prospects for elevating the underclass. ""For the foreseeable future,"" they wrote, ""the problems of low cognitive ability are not going to be solved by outside intervention."""
0719841,"And Bear in Mind (Editor's Choices of other recent books of particular interest) THE BELL CURVE: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life, by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray. (Free Press, $30.) The evidence the authors see indicates to them that society is layered in rough accordance with I.Q."
0720425,"""The Bell Curve,"" a flame-throwing treatise on race, class and intelligence by the late Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray advances a grisly thesis: I.Q., largely inherited and intractable, dictates an individual's success -- an economic death knell for much of America's black population. The story has America increasingly divided by race and sliding inexorably into castes based on I.Q."
0831034,"Recently, he has challenged the conclusions in ""The Bell Curve,"" Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's 1994 book about race and intelligence. Nor is he an admirer of standard methods of intelligence testing -- the Scholastic Aptitude Test developed by the Educational Testing Service, for example."
0720106,"Enter the social scientist Charles Murray and the psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein and their scramble through the thickets of psychometrics, the century-old science of human intelligence. Their new book, ""The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life"" (The Free Press), with its argument that intelligence is inherited, largely immutable and distributed unequally among ethnic groups, has loosed the predictably furious debate: Are I.Q. tests, upon which the authors rely heavily, accurate measures of brain power? Is the nature-nurture problem really largely irrelevant? Has science shown that black Americans, with a few exceptions, have little choice but to accept permanent second-class status (ameliorated, the authors suggest in a separate essay in The New Republic, by a pride of ""clan"")?"
0720238,"This may be the only real philosophical question raised by ""The Bell Curve,"" the book by Charles Murray and the late Richard Herrnstein that has monopolized magazine covers and inflamed pundits for two weeks."
0797456,"A monument of the genre was last year's ""The Bell Curve,"" by Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein, which argued that races differ in intellect and that heredity has much to do with the differences. Many scientists dismiss the book's statistical analysis as nonsense, but it has sold 400,000 copies."
0732032,"Scientists recently announced, for example, the discovery of a gene that makes mice get fat and that very well could be involved in some types of human obesity. The most notorious book of 1994, ""The Bell Curve,"" by Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein, insists that there is a strong heritable component to intelligence, and that, sorry, some ethnic groups have a greater share of the bright stuff than others. Researchers have put forth candidate genes for homosexuality, aggression and criminality, which for most of this century were attributed largely to social conditions and upbringing. And a steady stream of books about the evolution of behavior -- most notably ""The Moral Animal"" by Robert Wright -- argues that the hand of natural selection urges powerful men to dump their aging wives for nubile beauties, women to fixate on the thickness of a man's wallet, and both sexes to consider dallying in adulterous waters."
1109849,"Charles Murray, the conservative social analyst at the American Enterprise Institute and author of ''Losing Ground: American Social Policy, 1950-1980'' and, with Richard J. Herrnstein, ''The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life,'' views the persistence of idleness during boom times as a sign that ''the underclass is as big as it's ever been and may still be growing.''"
0997674,"Dr. Neisser sees his book as a rebuttal to the 1994 book by Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein, ''The Bell Curve,'' which argued that there is a strong link between I.Q. and income, and consequently, class and upward mobility. It noted the increase in I.Q. scores, but it did not see the upward movement as inconsistent with its thesis."
0721084,"Charles Murray, best known for attacking welfare, and Richard Herrnstein, an experimental psychologist who argued that intelligence is largely in the genes, built public careers as the dark angels of social science. And with the publication of ""The Bell Curve,"" their reputations have apparently been secured: The 845-page tract has driven liberal editorial writers to rug-chewing and led the editors of The New Republic to elicit 17 separate rebuttals."
0729187,"THE BELL CURVE: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life. By Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray. (Free Press, $30.) The evidence the authors see indicates to them that society is layered in rough accordance with I.Q. and that I.Q. is largely heritable, findings they believe society needs to take note of."
1529843,"But his record is hard to ignore. As the author of ''Losing Ground'' (1984), which argued that social programs do more harm than good, and then, with Richard J. Herrnstein, of ''The Bell Curve'' (1994), which theorized a genetic basis for class and IQ differences between blacks and whites, Mr. Murray has repeatedly managed what for a scholar is too rare a feat to be entirely accidental: to capture the national spotlight by arousing public ire. Is it any surprise that his latest book seems intended to inflame passions once again?"

1019856,"At the Cornell workshop, the normal curve was a historical reference and a prop. Prof. John Carson, who organized the workshop for the university's Department of Science and Technology Studies, took a copy of ''The Bell Curve,'' the much-debated 1994 best seller by Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein, and used its lurid cover illustration of the curve as a visual aid. The book was used by several other speakers, who by the end of a long day could draw a laugh just by waggling it."
0971372,"The issue of race and merit is freighted with emotional and political baggage, as was made clear when Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray published ''The Bell Curve'' (The Free Press, 1994), a best seller asserting that the likeliest explanation for the gap in scores is genetic."
1498933,"Mr. Murray, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, created an uproar in 1994 when his book ''The Bell Curve,'' written with Richard J. Herrnstein, linked intelligence, race and genes."
0716812,"With his new book, ""The Bell Curve"" (The Free Press), Murray has something even more dangerous and inflammatory on his mind: the relationship between race, class, genes and intelligence. Written with Richard Herrnstein of Harvard, who died last month at the age of 64, the book argues that I.Q. scores -- and their large genetic component -- are the key to understanding who gets ahead in America and who languishes in crime, poverty and dependency."
0734680,"In ""Behind the Curve"" (Op-Ed, Dec. 26), Myron A. Hofer mentions experiments on rats to buttress his argument that ""The Bell Curve"" by Charles Murray and the late Richard J. Herrnstein is faulty science. That book has been widely criticized, and rightly so."
0719208,"A highly sophisticated version of this reasoning can be found in an incendiary new book called ""The Bell Curve"" by Charles Murray, a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, and Richard J. Herrnstein, a professor of psychology at Harvard who died of cancer last month."

1269596,"To some degree, their resistance was based on moral qualms. From the late 19th-century social Darwinists, who invoked evolution to justify nationalism, war and poverty, to more recent thinkers like Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray, whose 1994 book ''The Bell Curve'' linked intelligence, race and genes, biological accounts of human affairs have frequently been accused of being simplistic and biased."

0726340,"""What Do I.Q. Tests Measure? Not Intelligence"" by Richard A.

1282756,"His views place him to the right of those who would throw out standardized tests altogether -- he wants to add, not subtract, and well to the left of I.Q. devotees like Dr. Richard J. Herrnstein and Dr. Charles Murray, authors of the 1994 book ''The Bell Curve.'' But some testing experts argue that Dr. Sternberg has yet to provide convincing evidence that the forms of intelligence he has identified are entirely distinct from what I.Q. tests measure."

So has the latest boomlet in the birthrate, called the baby boom echo, plus the rising cost of an undergraduate degree, which can now top $100,000."
0722990,"Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein produce evidence in their book ""The Bell Curve"" showing that the 15-point gap between white and black I.Q. scores remains even after controlling for all sorts of social factors. But there is one factor they do not discuss."
0734621,"After years of study, the best one can conclude is that teacher expectations, if they have any effect at all, are among the least important of the environmental variables that most scholars, including Charles Murray and Richard J.

1222336,"The genetic argument was repeated in a section of ''The Bell Curve'' (The Free Press, 1994 ) by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray. Other academics have offered a range of evidence to debunk their position, which caused an uproar. But Stephanie Robinson of the Education Trust, a nonprofit group in Washington that works with communities trying to raise test scores, says the book merely put into print notions hinted at elsewhere, from portrayals of blacks in film to banks' refusal to offer mortgages to those living in black neighborhoods."
0724800,"All this time when the country is cozy in bed with ""The Bell Curve"" by Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein. For many, justification that blacks have lower intelligence quotients perpetuates the scapegoating. But as the black Harvard professor Cornel West asserts in his book ""Race Matters"": ""We confine discussions about race to the 'problems' black people pose for whites, rather than consider what this way of viewing black people reveals about us as a nation."""
0712325,"This month, Dr. Herrnstein's latest book, ""The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life"" (The Free Press), is to be published. The ""bell curve"" refers to the bell-like image created by graphs of the distribution of I.Q. in the general population. The book carries forward Dr. Herrnstein's position that inherited abilities dictate intelligence and so determine success in life."
1214886,"Others are more forthright. Michael Willis was the marketing director at the Free Press in 1994, when the company published ''The Bell Curve'' by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray.''We thought it was very much the case that both professionals and the general public bought it to have it and didn't read it,'' he says. ''We got the sense even from reviews that people basically read the first chapter and the last.''"
0720878,"Now, in middle age, Mr. Murray gets his kicks by thinking up ways to drape the cloak of respectability over the obscene and long-discredited views of the world's most rabid racists. And so ""The Bell Curve,"" written with Richard Herrnstein, who died last month, promotes the view that blacks are inherently inferior to whites."
0902956,"In the Texaco case, black employees received raises that brought them to salary equality with their white counterparts. To Mr. Henderson this might sound fair, but would it sound fair to Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, who in their book, ''The Bell Curve,'' show that income equality already exists in corporate America if the determining factor is I.Q., not race?"
0720111,"But in recent years there is a surprising lack of agreement among scientists over the popular notions of what constitutes a racial group. And even in their book, ""The Bell Curve,"" which suggests that differences in intelligence between races are a matter of inheritance, Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray, duck the question. ""The rule we follow here is a simple one,"" they write, ""to classify people according to the way they classify themselves."""
0720110,"The very essence of the brain is this malleability, and that is what makes many biologists skeptical when social scientists or psychologists claim -- as Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray do in their new book, ""The Bell Curve"" -- that they have found evidence that intelligence is essentially inherent. Does mental dexterity reside among the general features of the brain, recorded in the pages of the recipe book called the genetic code? Or can it be more likely found in that vast appendix of chance occurrences called life?"
0725182,"Some will consider Malcolm W. Browne's review of Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray's ""Bell Curve,"" J. Philippe Rushton's ""Race, Evolution, and Behavior"" and Seymour W. Itzkoff's ""Decline of Intelligence in America"" politically faulty, and I am sure you will receive many letters criticizing the politics of both the reviewer and the authors. My criticism comes from a different point of view. I see little in this review to suggest that either Mr. Browne or the authors understand some basic principles of evolution."
0720772,"Which leads to ""The Bell Curve,"" the book that is the subject of current middle-brow hoopla. Its authors, Charles Murray and the late Richard Hernnstein, have tried to link chances of success to what they claim to be genetically ordained and ethnically determined I.Q.'s."
0726452,"Viewers may think twice before again using the terms ""highbrow"" and ""lowbrow"" culture. These terms originated with studies and drawings, included in the show, purporting to show that whites had higher foreheads to accommodate a larger cerebral cortex, while blacks had lower brows and a smaller cortex. Anthropologists later showed that the angle of the forehead varies within all groups, and that brain size is linked to body size, not to race or intelligence. After World War I, debate on intelligence shifted from spurious analysis of physical traits to the new science of I.Q., where it remains, flaring anew this year with the publication of ""The Bell Curve,"" by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray."
0763851,"After such a buildup, readers may be expecting some effective antidotes to the genetic pessimism of Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's ""Bell Curve."" If so, they will be disappointed. Mr. Perkins describes several educational programs that specifically teach problem solving, decision making, organization, creativity and other aspects of reflective intelligence. Unfortunately, his assessments of these, lacking significance tests, double blinds or other accepted evaluation measures, are inconclusive: ""No follow-up information is available""; ""improvements in classroom behavior resulted but not in academic performance or on standardized tests""; ""little information is available on whether . . . effects persist or are soon forgotten."" Maybe intelligence can be taught -- but can it be learned?"
1424320,"''It's conceivable that if you say anything is innate, people will say you are racist, but the climate has changed,'' he says. ''I don't actually believe that the I.Q. gap is genetic, so I didn't say anything nearly as inflammatory as Herrnstein and Murray,'' the authors of the 1994 book ''The Bell Curve,'' who argued that inborn differences in intelligence explain much of the economic inequality in American society."
0738402,"LOSING GROUND: American Social Policy, 1950-1980 By Charles Murray. Basic Books, $16. As welfare reform moves to the front burner, the author -- who won some fame, or infamy, as co-author of ""The Bell Curve"" -- has added a new introduction to the 10th-anniversary edition of this book."
0721353,"The I.Q. worshipers of today remain essentially unchanged from Goddard's time. Despite the impression that there is something new in ""The Bell Curve,"" its authors, Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein, have merely reasserted the long-unproven claim that I.Q. is mainly inherited. The language is calmer, the statistical gimmicks slicker, but the truth remains the same: There exist no plausible data to make the case. Belief to the contrary rests mainly on brutal preconceptions about poverty, but also on a basic confusion between pseudo-science and the real thing. BRENT STAPLES"
0964119,"Editorial Notebook by Michael M Weinstein says scholars have decisively shown the mistakes that riddle The Bell Curve, book whose genes-are-destiny thesis, laced with racial overtones, inflamed readers when it was published three years ago; says instead of surrendering to supposed genetic destiny for poor children, corrected message is that they can and should be taught (M)"
0749612,"""Whether this is good depends on what one thinks of abortion,"" Charles Murray said last summer. Mr. Murray is co-author of ""The Bell Curve"" (The Free Press, 1994), which theorizes that society is stratified by I.Q., which is based in part on genetic endowment."
0720885,"Jim Holt's article on ""The Bell Curve"" (Op-Ed, Oct. 19) made a number of important biological points about race and intelligence. His perspective becomes even richer if we consider the context of our evolutionary history."
0734262,"""It's where Charles Murray wrote 'The Bell Curve,' "" said Ms. Forbes, who is researching the effect of religion on politics."
0907950,"What his philosophy means for his readers would entail the end of expansive government and the welfare state. No more regulation of commerce. No more ''transfers of payment'' like Social Security, Medicare and food stamps. No more regulation of work places. Just a government that restrains people from injuring one another, enforces contracts and upholds what Mr. Murray defines in a strictly limited sense as the public good. A very minority position indeed, although hardly a surprise from the author of ''Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950-1980'' and (with Richard J. Herrnstein) ''The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life.''"
0726624,"The idea that you can explain the distribution of the ""goodies"" of life in this country by invoking arguments of race and genes is intellectually dishonest (""Daring Research or 'Social Science Pornography'?"" by Jason DeParle, Oct. 9). The public policy implications of ""The Bell Curve"" are merely Republican prescriptions for laissez-faire policies, with Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein cloaking their arguments in academic garb to gain respectability. They exalt the virtues of the marketplace and see government policies as assaults on the meritocracy. They ask us to ignore or forget that this meritocracy systematically excluded women, people of color, the disabled, etc. from the competitive process. Their argument is not new. Neither is abuse of so-called scientific research in the service of mean-spirited political objectives. THOMPSON F. WILLIAMS JR. Watertown, Mass."
0722989,"""The Bell Curve"" and other books on the relationship of heredity and intelligence have made some constructive suggestions -- the importance of more research on social maladjustment, and the need for more creative imagination than we now observe in planning social welfare and in education."
0720884,"In ""The Bell Curve,"" Charles Murray himself admits that the right environment can raise I.Q. Can he not see then that a disadvantaged environment can eat away at a young person's ability to learn? In America, racism and class prejudice have subjected entire populations to disadvantaged environments. Rather than stigmatize them, Mr. Murray should call for sensible action."
0911811,"This would hardly satisfy critics of affirmative action -- notably Charles Murray, co-author of ''The Bell Curve'' -- who argue that asking poorly prepared minorities to compete in the very best colleges reinforces racial stereotypes. Mr. Murray argues that affirmative action actually harms the intended beneficiaries by increasing their chance of failure. But here again, what seems obvious is apparently not true. While the nonwhites in Mr. Kane's sample did underperform their white counterparts at elite colleges even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, the performance gap was smaller than at unselective schools. Black or white, students from similar backgrounds who attended elite schools were more likely to finish school and had higher earnings if they did finish."
0725192,"Malcolm W. Browne cites Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray's argument that they can prove that intelligence tests are not systematically biased against blacks because ""if the S.A.T. is biased against blacks, it will underpredict their college performance."" Since their examination of ""hundreds of studies"" reveals that such tests do correctly predict performance, they conclude that these tests are therefore not biased."
1013441,"The entire book suffers from this lack of clarity. In a chapter on voyages to the moon in literature, Mr. Disch will be discussing, say, H. G. Wells, when suddenly Wells's ''evolutionary subtext'' will get him onto ''The Bell Curve,'' by Charles Murray, whose thesis, Mr. Disch writes, ''dismays for the same reason that 'The Time Machine' and 'The Origin of Species' do: it suggests that human nature is not a God-given absolute, but an un-Platonic variable, the function of our malleable genes.''  This makes sense only if you don't ask where Mr. Disch is coming from or where he's going."
0720886,"As a psychometrician, I welcome many aspects of Jim Holt's critique of ""The Bell Curve"" (Op-Ed, Oct. 19). But Mr. Holt uses a strategy long known to bigots who denigrate an outgroup. He clumps together all social science research and then assigns to the entire class characteristics of the most despicable members. While this may be seen as cleverness by some, it is the same brand of cleverness that makes ""The Bell Curve"" so loathsome."
0976871,"Black conservative intellectuals are faced with rebutting arguments like those made by Charles Murray in ''The Bell Curve,'' which suggested that blacks might be genetically inferior, or countering arguments made by Dinesh D'Souza in ''The End of Racism,'' which held that blacks are culturally inferior."
0725183,"The repudiation of racial groupings simply ignores well-established, interlocking forms of physiological, anatomical and genetic evidence for these groupings. The demand for an evolutionary rationale overlooks the fact that J. Philippe Rushton offers a strong causal, evolutionary hypothesis. Whether ultimately right or wrong, his hypothesis is a starting point for further research. Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray offer very little in the way of a causal theory; they're just organizing empirical information. But to repudiate all empirical information unless it already fits within a fully established causal theory -- as Mr. Pflaum demands -- is wholly arbitrary. Such ad hoc methodological restrictions are merely strategies of obfuscation and intellectual obstruction disguising themselves as scientific rigor. This kind of thing is, of course, nothing new. What is new, and worthy of some quiet celebration, is that objective scientific studies like those reviewed in the Book Review could get a fair, thoughtful and reasonable hearing in a major public forum. JOSEPH CARROLL  St. Louis"
0725184,"A few days after you published Malcolm W. Browne's quite favorable review of three new books that attribute intelligence primarily to genetic factors, I came across a discussion of intelligence testing in William Broad and Nicholas Wade's 1982 book, ""Betrayers of the Truth."" Mr. Broad and Mr. Wade list ""three cardinal principles"" for the use of intelligence tests, as laid down by the tests' inventor, Alfred Binet: ""Binet's Rule 1 was: The scores do not define anything innate or permanent. Rule 2: The scale is a rough guide for identifying and helping learning-disabled children; it is not a way of measuring normal children. Rule 3: Low scores don't mean a child is innately incapable."""
0828269,"But the counterrevolution has arrived fast. Last Saturday at my local Barnes  & Noble, Newt Gingrich's formerly best-selling ""To Renew America"" was stacked on the 50-percent-off table next to ""Kato Kaelin: The Whole Truth."" Dinesh D'Souza's ""The End of Racism,"" tirelessly promoted as a controversial ideological companion piece to ""The Bell Curve,"" never made the Times list. Neither have Mr. Gingrich's novel ""1945,"" Mr. D'Amato's ""Power, Pasta and Politics,"" Pat Robertson's ""The End of the Age"" or Ben Wattenberg's ""Values Matter Most."""
0828454,"Dr. Herrnstein's position at the center of debate over I.Q. would not have been predicted from his early career. His groundbreaking work in the 1950's and 1960's was in the field of behaviorist psychological theory, not intelligence."
0725196,"Malcolm W. Browne's excellent review of three new books on race and intelligence shows a healthy respect for empirical reality. It is a fact of nature that people are not created equal in the eyes of I.Q. tests. Concomitantly, and most fortunately, it is a fact of human nature that we can make all people equal in the eyes of the law. Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Sam Adams were not confused on that point, and this is no time to encourage obfuscation. JOHN HARTUNG  Atlantic Beach, L.I."
0725190,"The academic fields of inquiry vary very widely, indeed, as to internal agreements on assumptions, methods and interpretations. Disputes within, let us say, astrophysics and microbiology are hardly as pronounced as those within, for instance, economics and psychology. In these last, cultural and social preferences do shape intellectual work to a very large degree. Perhaps, then, it was Malcolm W. Browne's immersion in the more rigorous natural sciences that led him to characterize the authors under review as ""recognized by colleagues as serious scholars."" Leaving Seymour W. Itzkoff out of it, it is impossible to discern in the American academy any general acceptance for the view that Richard J. Herrnstein, Charles Murray and J. Philippe Rushton merit the designation ""serious."" Large numbers of us consider their writings to be prima facie evidence for ideological blindness and, indeed, fanaticism and hatred. That is a kind of seriousness -- but not the sort, clearly, Mr. Browne was thinking of. NORMAN BIRNBAUM  Washington"
0725181,"Ironically enough, the ancestors of the black sectors of this population were denied education in the hope that they would remain too ignorant to revolt against their slave condition. Today's geneticist authors worry that women with low intelligence scores ""are reproducing more rapidly than women with high scores"" (to quote ""The Bell Curve""). The same conclusion was reached by the WASP geneticists of the early 20th century, but they were referring not to blacks but to, among others, the poor Eastern European immigrants whose descendants now often obtain the highest scores on intelligence tests.  HERBERT J. GANS  New York"
0815352,"Mr. Crouch loves the stew of American democracy, the ferment of nationalities; what he calls the ""gumbo"" of our culture and ""our miscegenated identity as Americans."" This allows him to answer the question raised by Charles Murray in ""The Bell Curve"" of whether ""the majority of Negroes,"" in Mr. Crouch's words, ""are doomed by their genes to be less intelligent than white people."" Mr. Crouch simply asserts that ""no matter your definition of Afro-American culture, there is, quite frankly, no Afro-American race."""
0725197,"The debate intensified by the publication of ""The Bell Curve"" is about more than intelligence, achievement and race. It's about who and what is American, whom we choose to cherish and whom we discard. The most important campaign issue this season was immigration and how America's changing racial and ethnic composition affects the core values of our country. Proposition 187 in California was designed, among other things, to bar public schools from teaching illegal immigrants and to prevent hospitals from providing them with nonemergency medical care. Many of those who led the charge for Proposition 187 argued that the greatest danger of unchecked immigration is not to the economy, but to American culture itself."
0727895,"I would not be surprised to learn that Charles Murray, co-author of ""The Bell Curve,"" likes to eat at Denny's, when he's not sipping Champagne at 30,000 feet. Although the menu might not be up to the standard of food served at those private dinner parties where he expounds on the correlation of race, economic status and criminal behavior, his ideas would be equally welcome at Denny's. Murray might not even be disturbed that some Denny's patrons receive more prompt and courteous service than others. He'd probably attribute it to differences in I.Q. ROBERT J. YAES, M.D. Bronx"
0725188,"Similarly, the Armed Forces Qualifying Test, on which Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray rely heavily, has been shown to mismeasure the abilities of many young men. Because of an error in setting norms for the test, the United States military accepted a much higher percentage of low-scoring enlistees than it intended from 1976 to 1980. Yet the on-the-job performance of those new soldiers -- who would have been rejected if the test had been scored properly -- was essentially the same as those who really ""passed.""  PAMELA ZAPPARDINO  Cambridge, Mass."
0726626,"Regarding Charles Murray's research on intelligence, why prize this thing, I.Q., so highly? What exactly does it guarantee? Ethical behavior? The choice of socially useful work? Happiness? Wisdom?"
0726627,Charles Murray knows he treads on nonpolitically correct ground when he writes of genes and intellect. Proof of his theories is hard to come by and anecdotal evidence is not science.
0725186,"The authors of the three books reviewed by Malcolm W. Browne are to be commended on one insight they apparently share: that the growing gap between the higher-I.Q. upper classes and the lower-I.Q. ""underclass"" is deplorable. Beyond that, their brain cells seem to be lacking the serotonin needed to make some important intellectual connections. If I.Q.'s -- skewed as the tests may be -- can be increased even temporarily by Head Start, not to mention by good nutrition and housing, stable and caring homes, etc., surely there is more to nurture over nature than these scholars admit."
0725187,"That would never happen, nor should it. I.Q. scores in themselves tell you almost nothing. This was clearly explained by the Frenchmen Alfred Binet, who invented the first usable I.Q. test in 1905. The test had one purpose: to help identify learning-disabled children who needed special schools. Binet warned that a ""brutal pessimism"" would follow if his test was ever mistaken as a measure of a fixed, unchangeable intelligence."
0720887,"There are many flaws in the racial inferiority theory put forward in ""The Bell Curve,"" namely Louie Armstrong, Maya Angelou, Fats Waller, Ella Fitzgerald, Mahalia Jackson, Rita Dove, Alvin Ailey, Toni Morrison, Billie Holliday, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, and so on."
0725191,"The Book Review could better serve its readers if, instead of repeating platitudes about J. Philippe Rushton's right to be heard, it were to exercise its responsibility to examine what Mr. Rushton is saying. Malcolm W. Browne quotes Rushton apologists to the effect that ""as science, there is nothing wrong with Rushton's work in principle."" Nothing could be farther from the truth, as even a cursory examination of Mr. Rushton's publications reveals. The bulk of his controversial claims are published in journals that do not adhere to the standard scientific procedures of review and criticism by scientific colleagues. STEVEN GREENE  Princeton, N.J."
0725189,"Malcolm W. Browne states that recent research in intelligence and its possible genetic link to race has been ""neither fashionable nor safe for the last three decades."" Whether or not study of this question has been seen as politically appropriate, in fact considerable research has been conducted during this period; very little of it, however, supports the conclusion that some races are cognitively less able than others."
0726625,"For the sciences, at any rate, the results suggest a contest of David-and-Goliath proportions. Using 34 reference works in four languages, Mr. Murray produced inventories for eight fields -- astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth sciences, physics, mathematics, medicine and technology -- as well as a combined index ranking scientists from all disciplines. In all, Europeans and North Americans account for 97 percent of scientific accomplishment."

But I have to admit to mixed emotions when defending their ""right"" to be served the kind of fat-and-cholesterol-laden platter depicted on your cover. To eat such a meal is to pay dearly indeed for the right to be served. Our minds don't necessarily conform to ""The Bell Curve."" Our bodies shouldn't either. DANIEL CADY Ann Arbor, Mich."
