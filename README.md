# Analysing the Evolution of Public Ideas: An Application of Natural Language Processing

Of the numerous concepts and ideas proposed in the scholarly literature, only some ideas come to become public over time. Examining the social science ideas deployed in newspaper media, \citet{hallett2019public} proposes that the social science ideas become public ideas via three career stages: when they are used as objects of interest (being the news), as interpretants (making sense of the news) and eventually as a credibility signal (used to boost the credibility of a news story without discussion or analysis of the idea itself). This Bachelor's thesis aimed to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for automating and scaling up the empirical analysis of social science ideas in newspaper media. We developed an information retrieval system of the social scientists to identify newspaper articles that mention a specific public idea, and we experimented with four different classification models to predict their career stages to develop an document classification System. The system was trained and evaluated using the gold standard of social science, which consisted of a sample of the public idea in the book 'The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life' authored by Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein. The final objective was to extend the document classification system to additional public ideas in order to understand how social science ideas evolve into the public sphere and to help retrieving additional newspaper articles for the social scientists and to update their analysis of how the social science ideas evolve in newspaper articles.
